## VMG-002

In the single-arm DYNAMITE study, what structural changes were measured at 9 months and what major adverse cardiac events were observed by 24 months after DynamX implantation?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "The primary co-endpoints were the difference in mean device area and mean in-device lumen area from postprocedure to 9 months as measured by optical coherence tomography." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "Postprocedural mean device area was 8.15 ± 0.64 mm2, and in-device lumen area 8.27±1.78 mm2." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 9-month follow-up, mean device area increased to 8.53 ± 1.71 mm2 (absolute difference: 0.37 ± 0.99 mm²; relative difference: 5.52 ± 14.8%, p = 0.010), and mean in-device lumen area decreased to 7.57 ± 1.86 mm2 (absolute difference: -0.70 ± 1.09 mm²; relative difference: -7.98 ± 14.9%, p <0.001)." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "A total of 55 patients (55 lesions) were enrolled." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "DYNAMITE (DYNAMX stent ImplanTation for the trEatment of complex coronary lesions) is an observational, prospective, single-arm, single-center cohort study that enrolled patients with de novo complex coronary lesions undergoing PCI with DynamX between September 2021 and August 2023." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 24-month follow-up, 4 patients (7.4%) experienced major adverse cardiac events, including one target vessel myocardial infarction and 4 target lesion revascularization events." [PMID:41765253].

**Source-first decision**

The independent answer retains both area changes and their P values, the single-arm design, and the 24-month four-patient MACE result with event types. No unsupported scaffold mechanism or comparative efficacy appears. Baseline values and the expanded study name add unnecessary length.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: From postprocedure to 9 months, mean device area increased by 0.37 mm² (P=0.010), while mean in-device lumen area decreased by 0.70 mm² (P<0.001).

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. In the same pilot study of 21 veterans with HIV and 20 controls, patients with HIV showed lower right heart function on cardiac MRI, and the authors reported that limited data from this pilot suggest HIV may be associated with decreased right ventricular function [PMID:41791688]. The authors state that the study highlights the need for larger longitudinal studies to better understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes and to help improve cardiac disease prevention in this population; because the reported pilot data are cross-sectional, they cannot describe that trajectory [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Retains GDF-15, extracellular volume, lower right-heart function, the 21/20 population and cautious interpretation. The final explanation explicitly says the cross-sectional pilot cannot describe the longitudinal trajectory. Strict answer content passes, but the displayed complete evidence label conflicts with the still-missing longitudinal evidence; record a presentation mismatch separately. Findings are repeated.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population.

Required evidence boundary: The cross-sectional pilot does not show the trajectory of cardiac changes or whether HIV causes them; larger longitudinal evidence is missing.

## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "This study introduces SCAR-Net, a deep learning model specifically designed for ultrasound-based discrimination between these similar-appearing tissues." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "The model also demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy with Dice coefficients of 0.918-0.925 compared to traditional methods (0.795-0.811)." [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

The independent answer preserves the development sample and architecture separately from multicenter radiologist validation performance, without inventing a validation partition. Additional segmentation results are supported but not required.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: SCAR-Net was developed from 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients at four hospitals and used scar-recurrence feature-enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention modules.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Saturation binding assays showed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited higher binding affinity for LGR5 (Kd = 74.11 ± 24.52 nM) than [68Ga]Ga-LTP-01 (Kd = 153.40 ± 17.14 nM)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) than in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Consistently, the tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 xenograft model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Moreover, biodistribution studies further confirmed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 can specifically target LGR5-positive tumors." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both tracers in MC38-Nectin4 cells (Nectin4+) compared with MC38 cells (Nectin4-negative, Nectin4-)." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio increased progressively over time and reached its maximum at 120 min post-injection (p.i.)." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "Moreover, tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 was consistently higher than that of [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "Collectively, [68Ga]Ga-/[18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 demonstrated excellent stability, high target specificity, and partial hepatobiliary elimination, highlighting their potential as promising PET probes for imaging Nectin4-expressing tumors." [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

Both preclinical sources retain target-positive versus negative tumor localization, including the Nectin4 tumor comparison. Binding affinity, biodistribution, timing and within-Nectin4 probe comparison are source-supported but unnecessary. The answer does not rank the LGR5 and Nectin4 programs or claim proven accuracy in patients.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The AI system triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%; 95% CI: 173, 216) examinations with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "Conclusion Triaging by this AI system improved simulated diagnostic workflow efficiency without compromising diagnostic accuracy for csPCa." [PMID:41960994].

**Source-first decision**

Preserves simulated prostate pathway sensitivity/specificity changes and separate breast multicenter radiologist improvements. Calibration/test counts have their source roles; the breast development cohort is not relabeled as a separate validation set. Additional source context is verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: In simulated prostate-MRI triage, the AI pathway maintained sensitivity at 89.0% while increasing specificity by 11.5 percentage points to 69.2% versus the conventional pathway.

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Traditional MRI methodologies require full k-space information, which follows a unique data acquisition sequence to reconstruct the complete image." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "This process presents a time-consuming obstacle for medical imaging techniques." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Our study proposes a novel image reconstruction method to enhance the efficiency of data acquisition while maintaining high accuracy in activation detection." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "The through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques are combined to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme are used to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Due to the inherent correlation between Rice's noise and the Magnetic Resonance (MR) signal that occurs during the MR images formation, denoising these images is an important but complex process, as it can prove insufficient and even result in the loss of information details." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "To overcome these two drawbacks, filtering methods based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have been introduced, but the parameters of the filters they propose must be determined with great accuracy." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "In fact, in order to denoise MR images with high Rice's noise levels, we propose adapted filtering anisotropic diffusion PDE filter models by using precise local parameters adjustment." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "Three unbiased anisotropic diffusion filtering models with optimized parameters for Rician noise removing in MR images.." [PMID:41903663]. By applying the approach to both simulated and experimental fMRI data, the authors report reducing total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI), and compared with conventional reconstruction strategies the proposed method demonstrates potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions, while also providing voxel-wise estimates through a Bayesian framework [PMID:41951145]. The various tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to some other published methods, demonstrating the high performance of the proposed filters in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

The independent response preserves both distinct methods and all required validation qualifiers. The two validation paragraphs follow their own citations despite interleaved ordering. Background quotations and the diffusion-paper title are unnecessary, but no unsupported cross-method ranking appears.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was used as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular morbidity." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Multivariate regression models were applied to investigate the associations of FV and dialysis vintage with LVMI, and to assess potential interactions between these variables." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "A total of 241 patients were included." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "AV access flow was quantified as brachial artery flow volume (FV) using pulsed Doppler ultrasonography." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "The mean FV was 0.71 ± 0.29 L/min, and the median dialysis vintage was 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.0-11.0 years)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Moreover, no statistically significant interaction was observed (mean difference = 0.13; 95% CI: -3.14 to 3.40; p = 0.94)." [PMID:41644509]. Because the study was a multicenter cross-sectional design that enrolled hemodialysis patients undergoing both transthoracic echocardiography and AV access flow measurement between April 2014 and January 2024, it can document an association between AV access flow and LVMI but cannot establish that lowering access flow would improve cardiac outcomes [PMID:41644509].

**Source-first decision**

The source-bound association and null dialysis-vintage contrast are intact. The independently generated explanation explicitly limits cross-sectional association versus an intervention benefit and introduces no concurrent/simultaneous measurement schedule.

  > Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; <i>p</i> = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; <i>p</i> = 0.27).

- **C2**: Its cross-sectional design establishes neither temporal causality nor whether an intervention to reduce flow would lower LV mass or clinical cardiovascular events.

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with AVB." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "After adjusting for all factors considered, maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "A total of 3455 vaginal births were included: 3090 spontaneous vaginal births and 365 AVB." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "Retrospective observational monocentric study conducted on the cohort of women with singleton pregnancies who delivered vaginally in 2023 at the Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "A secondary analysis compared maternal and neonatal outcomes between perineal and mid/low cavity vacuum applications." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic applications were associated with greater blood loss (p < 0.01), higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01)." [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All adjusted associations and mid/low-versus-perineal outcome comparisons are preserved with the correct directions, percentages and source. Added design and cohort sentences are supported but verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Older maternal age, mode of conception, epidural analgesia, later gestational age, and male newborn sex were positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, whereas parity was inversely associated.

## VMG-042

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the comparative data needed to establish that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

The independent refusal correctly identifies the absent comparative evidence for local-control/survival benefit versus nonadaptive radiotherapy. It does not substitute an absent-outcome explanation.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
