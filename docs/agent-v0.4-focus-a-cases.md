## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

The pilot study included 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) [PMID:41791688]. Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations [PMID:41791688]. The study found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV [PMID:41791688]. These findings suggest the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population [PMID:41791688]. Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function [PMID:41791688]. The study is cross-sectional and highlights the need for larger longitudinal studies to understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes; it does not provide longitudinal data.

**Source-first decision**

Both groups (21 HIV veterans and 20 controls), GDF-15/ECV/right-heart findings and suggestive noncausal wording are present. Names the cross-sectional design and missing longitudinal trajectory. The additional multivariable-regression statement is supported by the same abstract.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population.

Required evidence boundary: The cross-sectional pilot does not show the trajectory of cardiac changes or whether HIV causes them; larger longitudinal evidence is missing.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

Saturation binding assays showed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited higher binding affinity for LGR5 (Kd = 74.11 ± 24.52 nM) than [68Ga]Ga-LTP-01 (Kd = 153.40 ± 17.14 nM) [PMID:42000453]. Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) than in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL) [PMID:42000453]. Consistently, the tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 xenograft model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10) [PMID:42000453]. Among them, [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors [PMID:42000453]. Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both tracers in MC38-Nectin4 cells (Nectin4+) compared with MC38 cells (Nectin4-negative, Nectin4-) [PMID:41916034]. In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower [PMID:41916034]. The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio increased progressively over time and reached its maximum at 120 min post-injection (p.i.) [PMID:41916034]. Moreover, tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 was consistently higher than that of [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

Both studies' target-specific positive/negative model contrasts are explicit, including A549 versus NCI-H1299 uptake and MC38-Nectin4 versus MC38 uptake. Extra binding-affinity, tumor-to-muscle and 120-minute statements match their own abstracts. No patient diagnostic-accuracy or cross-study head-to-head claim; duplicate restoration is absent.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study reported that Ga-LTP-02 showed superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and localized LGR5-positive tumors effectively.

## VMG-011

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow involving MRI examinations of 500 men with suspected csPCa from four European centers, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1). The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001). The AI system triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%; 95% CI: 173, 216) examinations with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9) [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1)." [PMID:41960994]. Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance in multicenter validation [PMID:42023157]. SCAR-Net increased AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001) [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

Both requested diagnostic comparisons, uncertainty and P values are retained; the prostate 400-test/500-total distinction is made explicit in the source quotation. However, the added clause 'Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients ... improved ... in multicenter validation' transfers the development-data count to the validation performance statement without identifying it as development data. The abstract gives these counts for model development, not a validation denominator. Count one incorrectly scoped material addition conservatively; no separate third-study aggregate is present.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: In simulated prostate-MRI triage, the AI pathway maintained sensitivity at 89.0% while increasing specificity by 11.5 percentage points to 69.2% versus the conventional pathway.

## VMG-013

What sensitivity-specificity tradeoff did simulated prostate-MRI AI triage show, and what real-world clinical effect remains untested?

**Saved Agent answer**

Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1) [PMID:41960994]. The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001) [PMID:41960994]. The AI system triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%; 95% CI: 173, 216) examinations with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9) [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "MRI examinations of 500 men with suspected csPCa from four European centers were included." [PMID:41960994]. The study is explicitly a simulation; real-world clinical effects such as actual workload reduction or patient outcomes in routine practice were not measured or tested.

**Source-first decision**

Includes both radiologist comparator values, both AI values, change magnitude, intervals and P values, with the 400-test/500-total populations. Explicitly states the study is a simulation and did not test actual workload reduction or patient outcomes in routine practice. The optional triaged-subgroup findings remain source-bound; the boundary refers to real-world effects, not an assertion that clinical outcomes were simulated.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The simulated AI pathway maintained sensitivity at 89.0% versus 89.4% for radiologists (P=0.36) and increased specificity by 11.5 percentage points to 69.2% (P<0.001).

  Evidence `pubmed:41960994:0`:

  > Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1).

## VMG-014

Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study is a simulation and does not provide data on actual biopsy reduction rates versus the conventional workflow. The study is a simulation and does not provide data on patient outcomes like mortality or quality of life versus the conventional workflow.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly states that this simulation does not provide actual biopsy-reduction rates or comparative patient-outcome data versus the conventional workflow. Mortality and quality of life are examples of absent patient outcomes, not claims that those outcomes were measured or simulated. No unsupported clinical benefit is asserted. The Agent checker incorrectly treats the explicit absence of evidence as a support/completeness failure and requests unavailable results.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: The simulation reports sensitivity, specificity, and examinations triaged but no prospective comparison of biopsy use, treatment, morbidity, or patient outcomes.

## VMG-024

For surveillance of local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence, what sensitivities were reported for nasopharyngeal-brush versus plasma EBV DNA testing?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a study of 187 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.7% for detecting local recurrence [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Patients without recurrence after more than 1 year of follow-up served as controls." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%)." [PMID:41631491]. In the same study, plasma EBV DNA testing demonstrated a sensitivity of 61.4% for detecting local recurrence [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included." [PMID:41631491].

**Source-first decision**

Both requested sensitivities (brush 95.7%, plasma 61.4%) are correct and separately attributed. Added 187-patient population, more-than-one-year control follow-up and 94.0%/96.6% specificity match the same abstract. Source quotations repeat some already answered information, a presentation limitation rather than an unsupported material claim.

**Frozen claims and evidence**
