## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "This study introduces SCAR-Net, a deep learning model specifically designed for ultrasound-based discrimination between these similar-appearing tissues." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

The repeated answer preserves the development dataset, the two architecture modules and the separately attributed multicenter radiologist improvements with all ranges/p values. No missing-evidence claim or unsupported validation denominator is added.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Saturation binding assays showed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited higher binding affinity for LGR5 (Kd = 74.11 ± 24.52 nM) than [68Ga]Ga-LTP-01 (Kd = 153.40 ± 17.14 nM)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) than in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Consistently, the tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 xenograft model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Moreover, biodistribution studies further confirmed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 can specifically target LGR5-positive tumors." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Among them, [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both tracers in MC38-Nectin4 cells (Nectin4+) compared with MC38 cells (Nectin4-negative, Nectin4-)." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio increased progressively over time and reached its maximum at 120 min post-injection (p.i.)." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "Moreover, tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 was consistently higher than that of [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "Collectively, [68Ga]Ga-/[18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 demonstrated excellent stability, high target specificity, and partial hepatobiliary elimination, highlighting their potential as promising PET probes for imaging Nectin4-expressing tumors." [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

Both correct preclinical sources were retrieved in this repeat. The answer preserves positive-versus-negative tumor/cell comparisons and all quoted uptake, affinity, ratio, time-point and clearance details match their own sources. No patient-efficacy or cross-target head-to-head claim is made. Unlike the first Flash run, this routing wording passes the unchanged identifier filter; the earlier failure is retained separately.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

## VMG-011

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The AI system triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%; 95% CI: 173, 216) examinations with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "MRI examinations of 500 men with suspected csPCa from four European centers were included." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "AI-triaging thresholds were calibrated on 100 examinations." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The workflow was simulated on 400 examinations, including examinations from an external site, incorporating assessments from 62 radiologists." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "This study introduces SCAR-Net, a deep learning model specifically designed for ultrasound-based discrimination between these similar-appearing tissues." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules."

[PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "Postoperative differentiation between scar tissue and recurrent lesions in patients with breast cancer presents a significant diagnostic challenge." [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

The repeated answer accurately keeps prostate calibration/test/cohort roles separate, reports the original reader comparators and all performance intervals, and preserves breast development-versus-validation scope. No unrequested gap or cross-study superiority claim remains. Ten source quotations make it unnecessarily lengthy.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: In simulated prostate-MRI triage, the AI pathway maintained sensitivity at 89.0% while increasing specificity by 11.5 percentage points to 69.2% versus the conventional pathway.

  Evidence `pubmed:41960994:0`:

Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide outcome data establishing: Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow.

**Source-first decision**

Independently rerun on the same source, the answer again withholds prospective biopsy/patient-outcome benefit versus radiologist-only workflow. It names the correct missing outcome and matches the first-round refusal text; no unsupported claim about missing patient follow-up is added.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: The simulation reports sensitivity, specificity, and examinations triaged but no prospective comparison of biopsy use, treatment, morbidity, or patient outcomes.

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "A Bayesian approach to 2D acceleration for studying activation detection rate for simultaneously encoded slice acquisition in FMRI.." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Our study proposes a novel image reconstruction method to enhance the efficiency of data acquisition while maintaining high accuracy in activation detection." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "The through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques are combined to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme are used to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Compared with conventional reconstruction strategies, the proposed method demonstrates potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions, while also providing voxel-wise estimates through a Bayesian framework." [PMID:41951145]. When applied to both simulated and experimental fMRI data, the proposed method successfully reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI), and compared with conventional reconstruction strategies it demonstrated potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Three unbiased anisotropic diffusion filtering models with optimized parameters for Rician noise removing in MR images.." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "In fact, in order to denoise MR images with high Rice's noise levels, we propose adapted filtering anisotropic diffusion PDE filter models by using precise local parameters adjustment." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "Due to the inherent correlation between Rice's noise and the Magnetic Resonance (MR) signal that occurs during the MR images formation, denoising these images is an important but complex process, as it can prove insufficient and even result in the loss of information details." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "To overcome these two drawbacks, filtering methods based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have been introduced, but the parameters of the filters they propose must be determined with great accuracy." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "The various tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to some other published methods, thus demonstrating the high performance of the proposed filters in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details." [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

The repeated answer retains both methods, all required implementation details and their correctly qualified validation findings. Every quotation and the fMRI paraphrase match their respective sources; the first-round contradictory validation gap is absent. Repeated background and method sentences remain unnecessarily long.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "AV access flow was quantified as brachial artery flow volume (FV) using pulsed Doppler ultrasonography." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Multivariate regression models were applied to investigate the associations of FV and dialysis vintage with LVMI, and to assess potential interactions between these variables." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "The mean FV was 0.71 ± 0.29 L/min, and the median dialysis vintage was 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.0-11.0 years)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Moreover, no statistically significant interaction was observed (mean difference = 0.13; 95% CI: -3.14 to 3.40; p = 0.94)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "A total of 241 patients were included." [PMID:41644509]. The study cannot establish that lowering access flow improves cardiac outcomes because it is a multicenter cross-sectional study and it used left ventricular mass index (LVMI) only as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular morbidity; the authors themselves note that whether AV access blood flow and the duration of exposure to this flow have independent or interactive effects on cardiac outcomes remains unclear [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024." [PMID:41644509]. The authors suggest that AV access flow may serve as a candidate variable in future left ventricular hypertrophy prediction algorithms and cardio-renal machine learning models because of its linear and independently significant association with LVMI, implying that longitudinal or interventional study designs would be needed to test causal effects on outcomes, but the retrieved evidence does not specify what particular study design would be required [PMID:41644509]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: What kind of evidence or study design would be required to establish that lowering access flow improves cardiac outcomes.

**Source-first decision**

The repeated answer preserves all required association/null-comparator estimates and correctly explains the cross-sectional and surrogate-outcome limits. Unlike the first run it does not use nonsignificant interaction as the reason causal inference fails. The general need for longitudinal/interventional evidence is marked as an implication, with no particular study design asserted from the source. An unrequested future-design component produces a partial label, and the answer is longer than needed.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:41644509:0`:

  > Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; <i>p</i> = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; <i>p</i> = 0.27).

- **C2**: Its cross-sectional design establishes neither temporal causality nor whether an intervention to reduce flow would lower LV mass or clinical cardiovascular events.

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the required comparative data for: Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

The repeated refusal retains the correct missing comparative local-control/survival evidence and does not deny that the single cohort reported follow-up outcomes. Text matches the independently generated first-round refusal.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
