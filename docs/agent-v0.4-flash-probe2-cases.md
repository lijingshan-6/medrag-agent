How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

SCAR-Net was developed using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules. However, the retrieved evidence does not provide the base architecture type (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet), training hyperparameters, loss functions, data augmentation protocols, or specific validation split ratios [PMID:42023157]. In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001) [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

Development counts, module names and radiologist performance changes including significance match the source. The answer still lists truthful but unasked missing implementation details.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

Dynamic PET imaging revealed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 uptake in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts was 4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL, compared to 0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts, demonstrating target-specific accumulation. The tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10). Saturation binding assays confirmed target affinity with a Kd of 74.11 ± 24.52 nM, and biodistribution studies further confirmed specific targeting of LGR5-positive tumors [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Saturation binding assays showed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited higher binding affinity for LGR5 (Kd = 74.11 ± 24.52 nM) than [68Ga]Ga-LTP-01 (Kd = 153.40 ± 17.14 nM)." [PMID:42000453]. Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 and [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 in MC38-Nectin4 cells (Nectin4+) compared with MC38 cells (Nectin4-). PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower. The tumor-to-muscle ratio increased progressively over time. The retrieved evidence does not provide quantified absolute tumor uptake values in %ID/g or %ID/mL for the Nectin4 probes [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio increased progressively over time and reached its maximum at 120 min post-injection (p.i.)." [PMID:41916034]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: quantified absolute tumor uptake (%ID/g or %ID/mL).

**Source-first decision**

Separate positive/negative target-model contrasts and LGR5 affinity/localization evidence support the requested preclinical findings. Higher uptake is no longer called superior specificity. An unasked absolute Nectin4 uptake requirement creates a false partial label and repetition, but does not contradict a reported number.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study reported that Ga-LTP-02 showed superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and localized LGR5-positive tumors effectively.

  Evidence `pubmed:42000453:0`:

  > Among them, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors.

- **C2**: The second study found that the tracer accumulated specifically in Nectin4-expressing tumor models, with lower uptake in non-targeted tumors.

  Evidence `pubmed:41916034:0`:

  > In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower.

Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide outcome data establishing: Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly states the absence of outcome evidence for biopsy reduction or patient benefit versus radiologists; the fixed wording retains the requested comparison.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: The simulation reports sensitivity, specificity, and examinations triaged but no prospective comparison of biopsy use, treatment, morbidity, or patient outcomes.

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The fMRI acceleration method addressed the problem of lengthy scan times in traditional MRI by combining through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions, along with multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage [PMID:41951145]. Validation showed that the fMRI acceleration method successfully reduced total scan time while achieving higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest, demonstrating potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions [PMID:41951145]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters addressed the problem of Rician noise removal in MR images, which is complex because noise is correlated with the MR signal and can result in insufficient denoising or loss of information details. The method uses optimized parameters calculated simultaneously and adaptively through the PSO algorithm and quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, BRISQUE) [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663]. Validation demonstrated that the anisotropic-diffusion filters provided excellent results on synthetic and real MR images compared to other published methods, showing high performance in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

Both methods and validation findings are supported and no conflicting gap remains. Strict failure: the fMRI validation omits the required simulated-and-experimental-data condition, although the diffusion validation correctly names synthetic and real images.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a multicenter cross-sectional study of 241 hemodialysis patients, higher arteriovenous access flow (measured as brachial artery flow volume) was significantly associated with increased left ventricular mass index (mean difference = 22.83; 95% CI: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046) [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. This study cannot establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes because it used a cross-sectional design that measured exposure and outcome simultaneously, which cannot demonstrate temporal causality or that modifying the exposure would result in changed outcomes [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was used as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular morbidity." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Multivariate regression models were applied to investigate the associations of FV and dialysis vintage with LVMI, and to assess potential interactions between these variables." [PMID:41644509].

**Source-first decision**

The association, null contrast and design limitation are present. As in the prior review, asserting simultaneous measurement goes beyond the described protocol and counts as one unsupported material addition.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:41644509:0`:

  > Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; <i>p</i> = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; <i>p</i> = 0.27).

- **C2**: Its cross-sectional design establishes neither temporal causality nor whether an intervention to reduce flow would lower LV mass or clinical cardiovascular events.

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the retrospective cohort of 3455 vaginal births (365 assisted vaginal births and 3090 spontaneous vaginal births), multivariable logistic regression identified maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) as independent positive associations with assisted vaginal birth, while parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) showed an inverse association [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "After adjusting for all factors considered, maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated." [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic vacuum applications were associated with significantly greater blood loss (p < 0.01), a higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use during delivery (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01) [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All adjusted factors, cohort counts and pelvic/perineal comparisons are correct. A parser defect split a string detail into characters, causing two unnecessary repairs and a false unresolved self-check/partial label; this does not negate the supported answer.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Older maternal age, mode of conception, epidural analgesia, later gestational age, and male newborn sex were positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, whereas parity was inversely associated.

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the required comparative data for: Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

Correct comparative refusal despite single-cohort survival outcomes; no claim that survival was unmeasured.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
