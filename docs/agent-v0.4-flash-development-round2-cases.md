In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, what cardiac MRI findings in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans at Providence VA Medical Center, cardiac MRI findings of increased extracellular volume and lower right heart function among 21 patients with HIV suggested the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction compared to 20 controls without HIV [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Correct matched-population MRI findings and cautious interpretation; redundant source quotations remain.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Compared with controls, veterans with HIV had increased myocardial extracellular volume and lower right-heart function on MRI; the authors said these findings suggested increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

The cross-sectional pilot study of 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years) found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume on cardiac MRI, and lower right heart function among patients with HIV compared to controls, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical right ventricular dysfunction in this population [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. The study highlights that larger longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes and help improve cardiac disease prevention in this population, leaving the longitudinal progression of these findings unanswered [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Both pilot findings and the unanswered longitudinal trajectory are correctly stated. Complete coverage still mislabels the missing outcome.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

SCAR-Net is a deep learning model specifically designed for ultrasound-based discrimination between postoperative breast scars and recurrent lesions. The model was developed using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules [PMID:42023157]. SCAR-Net was validated in a multicenter validation study. The evidence does not provide specific validation split proportions or protocol details beyond the multicenter setting [PMID:42023157]. In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001). The model also demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy with Dice coefficients of 0.918-0.925 compared to traditional methods (0.795-0.811) [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

Development scale, model modules and multicenter assisted-reader metrics are correct. Absence of split details is accurate but unasked, and adjacent segmentation results add length.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: SCAR-Net was developed from 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients at four hospitals and used scar-recurrence feature-enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention modules.

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [^68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) compared with LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL), with corresponding tumor-to-muscle ratios of 4.07 ± 0.07 versus 0.77 ± 0.10, respectively. Biodistribution studies confirmed specific targeting of LGR5-positive tumors, demonstrating superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression [PMID:42000453]. Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both [^68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 and [^18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 in Nectin4-positive MC38-Nectin4 cells compared with Nectin4-negative MC38 cells. Biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower, with tumor-to-muscle ratios increasing progressively to maximum at 120 minutes post-injection. [^68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 consistently showed higher tumor uptake than [^18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

Both target-localization findings now retain the positive/negative tumor comparisons. Reported LGR5 sensitivity/specificity remains restricted to preclinical evidence; no cross-tracer ranking.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study reported that Ga-LTP-02 showed superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and localized LGR5-positive tumors effectively.

  > Among them, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors.

- **C2**: The second study found that the tracer accumulated specifically in Nectin4-expressing tumor models, with lower uptake in non-targeted tumors.

  Evidence `pubmed:41916034:0`:

  > In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower.

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow using data from 500 men with suspected clinically significant prostate cancer across four European centers, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1). The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001). The AI system triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%) examinations with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9) [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1)." [PMID:41960994].

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The fMRI acceleration method addressed image-reconstruction problems by combining through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques to accelerate acquisition along two dimensions, using multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage, all within a Bayesian framework for 2D acceleration in simultaneously encoded slice acquisition for fMRI [PMID:41951145]. The fMRI acceleration method reported validation results showing reduced total scan time while achieving higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI) using both simulated and experimental fMRI data, with potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions compared to conventional reconstruction strategies [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Compared with conventional reconstruction strategies, the proposed method demonstrates potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions, while also providing voxel-wise estimates through a Bayesian framework." [PMID:41951145]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters addressed image-reconstruction problems by developing three unbiased anisotropic diffusion filtering models with optimized parameters for Rician noise removal, incorporating a robust Rician noise estimator and unbiased filter variants whose parameters are calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively using the PSO algorithm and quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, BRISQUE) [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "Due to the inherent correlation between Rice's noise and the Magnetic Resonance (MR) signal that occurs during the MR images formation, denoising these images is an important but complex process, as it can prove insufficient and even result in the loss of information details." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "To overcome these two drawbacks, filtering methods based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have been introduced, but the parameters of the filters they propose must be determined with great accuracy." [PMID:41903663]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters reported validation results demonstrating high performance in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details, with excellent results on tests performed on synthetic and real MR images compared to other published methods [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

Mechanisms and both validation data types/findings are correct. Extensive repeated quotations are a remaining presentation defect.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a multicenter cross-sectional study of 241 hemodialysis patients who underwent both transthoracic echocardiography and AV access flow measurement, higher arteriovenous access flow (measured as brachial artery flow volume) was significantly associated with increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), with a mean difference of 22.83 (95% CI: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27) [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024." [PMID:41644509].

**Source-first decision**

Association and null contrast are complete, but C2 remains a design quote rather than an explanation. Timing assertions were rejected in all repairs. This time the unresolved binding issue remains visible and the self-check correctly fails.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:41644509:0`:

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort of 3455 vaginal births (365 AVB vs 3090 spontaneous vaginal births), multivariable logistic regression identified maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) as factors positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, while parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated with AVB [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low-pelvic vacuum applications were associated with greater blood loss (p < 0.01), a higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use during delivery (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01) [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All adjusted predictors with ORs/CIs and pelvic-versus-perineal comparison details are retained.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, what did online adaptation change in target coverage and organ-at-risk dose, and what treatment-time and toxicity results were reported?

**Saved Agent answer**

Online adaptation significantly improved target coverage, with a median V100% change of +0.1% ± 2.5% compared to predicted plans that had a median change of -2.6% ± 7.3% (p < 0.001) [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "A total of 41 patients were enrolled, receiving 232 fractions, of which 178 (76.7%) were treated with ASRT." [PMID:42058324]. Online adaptation did not produce significant differences in organ-at-risk doses [PMID:42058324]. The median total treatment time was 28 minutes, with an average ASRT workflow of 5 minutes [PMID:42058324]. No grade ≥ 3 toxicities were reported; grade 2 events occurred in 10.3% of patients [PMID:42058324].

**Source-first decision**

Correct dosimetry contrasts, treatment/workflow time, and grade-specific toxicity; no clinical superiority claim.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Online adaptation improved median V100% target coverage relative to predicted plans (+0.1%±2.5% vs -2.6%±7.3%; P<0.001) without a significant OAR-dose difference.

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the comparative data needed to establish that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

Correct missing nonadaptive control boundary, without denying the observed single-arm outcomes.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
