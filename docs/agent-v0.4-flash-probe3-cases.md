How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

SCAR-Net was developed using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules, and validated in multicenter validation [PMID:42023157]. In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001) [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

In preclinical models, Nectin4-targeted probes showed target-specific tumor localization: cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 and [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 in Nectin4-positive MC38-Nectin4 cells compared with Nectin4-negative MC38 cells; biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models while uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower; the tumor-to-muscle ratio increased progressively over time reaching maximum at 120 minutes post-injection; and tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 was consistently higher than that of [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined [PMID:41916034]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Preclinical tumor-localization data for [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-expressing models.

**Source-first decision**

Nectin4 findings are supported. The LGR5 source was not retrieved, so the requested LGR5 evidence is omitted; retain this retrieval failure.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study reported that Ga-LTP-02 showed superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and localized LGR5-positive tumors effectively.

  Evidence `pubmed:42000453:0`:

  > Among them, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors.

- **C2**: The second study found that the tracer accumulated specifically in Nectin4-expressing tumor models, with lower uptake in non-targeted tumors.

  Evidence `pubmed:41916034:0`:

  > In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower.

Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide outcome data establishing that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly refuses to infer avoided biopsies or patient benefit versus radiologist-only care from diagnostic evidence.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: The simulation reports sensitivity, specificity, and examinations triaged but no prospective comparison of biopsy use, treatment, morbidity, or patient outcomes.

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The fMRI acceleration method addressed the image-reconstruction problem by combining through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions, while using multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage [PMID:41951145]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters addressed the image-reconstruction problem by incorporating a robust Rician noise estimator and unbiased variants of anisotropic diffusion filters, with parameters calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the PSO algorithm using reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, BRISQUE) [PMID:41903663]. The fMRI acceleration method validation reported higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest while reducing total scan time, with potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions compared to conventional reconstruction strategies [PMID:41951145]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters validation reported excellent results on synthetic and real MR images compared to other published methods, demonstrating high performance in noise reduction and preservation of important details [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

Both methods and findings are supported, but the fMRI validation omits the required simulated and experimental data qualifier. Same rule as probe2.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

  > By applying our approach to both simulated and experimental fMRI data, we successfully reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI).

- **C2**: The MR filters used adaptively optimized anisotropic-diffusion models and a Rician-noise estimator; tests on synthetic and real MR images reported noise reduction with preservation of important details.

  Evidence `pubmed:41903663:0`:

  > These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE)).

  Evidence `pubmed:41903663:0`:

  > The various tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to some other published methods, thus demonstrating the high performance of the proposed filters in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a multicenter cross-sectional study of 241 hemodialysis patients, higher AV access flow (measured as brachial artery flow volume) was significantly associated with increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), with a mean difference of 22.83 (95% CI: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046). The study found a linear and independently significant association between AV access flow and LVMI [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Explicit statement explaining why the cross-sectional design cannot establish that lowering access flow would improve cardiac outcomes (causation/intervention effect).

**Source-first decision**

Association, cohort and null contrast are supported. The response declines to explain the design-derived causal limitation, so C2 is not answered.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:41644509:0`:

  > Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; <i>p</i> = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; <i>p</i> = 0.27).

- **C2**: Its cross-sectional design establishes neither temporal causality nor whether an intervention to reduce flow would lower LV mass or clinical cardiovascular events.

  Evidence `pubmed:41644509:0`:

  > In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024.

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort of 3455 vaginal births (365 AVB and 3090 spontaneous vaginal births), multivariable logistic regression identified factors independently associated with assisted vaginal birth: maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic vacuum applications were associated with greater blood loss (p<0.01), a higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p=0.03), and increased ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%, p<0.01) [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All six adjusted predictors with ORs and CIs, delivery groups and pelvic comparisons are retained correctly.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Older maternal age, mode of conception, epidural analgesia, later gestational age, and male newborn sex were positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, whereas parity was inversely associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:42036403:0`:

  > After adjusting for all factors considered, maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated.

- **C2**: Compared with perineal applications, mid/low-pelvic applications had greater blood loss, a higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%), and more ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%).

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the comparative data needed to establish that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly identifies the missing adaptive versus nonadaptive local-control and survival comparison.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
