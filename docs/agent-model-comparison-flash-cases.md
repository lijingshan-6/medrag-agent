## VMG-001

In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, what cardiac MRI findings in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

The quoted findings and cautious pilot conclusion directly match the HIV source. The supporting sample description is also accurate. No causal or longitudinal inference is added; complete coverage is appropriate.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Compared with controls, veterans with HIV had increased myocardial extracellular volume and lower right-heart function on MRI; the authors said these findings suggested increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

## VMG-002

In the single-arm DYNAMITE study, what structural changes were measured at 9 months and what major adverse cardiac events were observed by 24 months after DynamX implantation?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Postprocedural mean device area was 8.15 ± 0.64 mm2, and in-device lumen area 8.27±1.78 mm2." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 9-month follow-up, mean device area increased to 8.53 ± 1.71 mm2 (absolute difference: 0.37 ± 0.99 mm²; relative difference: 5.52 ± 14.8%, p = 0.010), and mean in-device lumen area decreased to 7.57 ± 1.86 mm2 (absolute difference: -0.70 ± 1.09 mm²; relative difference: -7.98 ± 14.9%, p <0.001)." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "A total of 55 patients (55 lesions) were enrolled." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 24-month follow-up, 4 patients (7.4%) experienced major adverse cardiac events, including one target vessel myocardial infarction and 4 target lesion revascularization events." [PMID:41765253].

**Source-first decision**

Source quotations correctly distinguish postprocedural measurements from nine-month changes and the number of patients with MACE from event counts at 24 months. No unsupported comparative efficacy claim is made.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: From postprocedure to 9 months, mean device area increased by 0.37 mm² (P=0.010), while mean in-device lumen area decreased by 0.70 mm² (P<0.001).

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Participants were extensively phenotyped with questionnaires, physical exam, stress test, echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, coronary calcium score, and blood measurement of markers of inflammation and fibrosis." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function." [PMID:41791688]. The pilot study identified that the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes remains unknown and requires larger longitudinal studies to better understand how myocardial fibrosis and RV dysfunction develop over time in people living with HIV and to help improve cardiac disease prevention in this population [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Findings and participant counts match the source, with cautious pilot/association wording. The answer explicitly identifies the unknown trajectory and need for longitudinal studies. The complete label differs from the partial-evidence contract; this is a presentation/contract mismatch, not a false longitudinal conclusion. The full phenotyping-method list is unnecessary for the question.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

  > We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population.

Required evidence boundary: The cross-sectional pilot does not show the trajectory of cardiac changes or whether HIV causes them; larger longitudinal evidence is missing.

## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

Both source quotations preserve the architecture modules, development dataset role, separate multicenter reader-performance results, all numerical ranges and their p-value qualification. No unsupported validation sample size or biopsy outcome is introduced.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: SCAR-Net was developed from 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients at four hospitals and used scar-recurrence feature-enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention modules.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not establish: Tumor model, imaging time point, and tumor uptake values for [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Tumor model, imaging time point, and tumor uptake values for Nectin4-targeted probes. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Evidence of target specificity for [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Evidence of target specificity for Nectin4-targeted probes.

**Source-first decision**

The answer refuses both target-specific findings even though the frozen corpus contains the two requested sources. Final retrieved evidence is empty; the trace shows no study-selection LLM call and three zero-evidence grading decisions. The complete gold question is not answered, and the self-check incorrectly accepts this as sufficient. Trace/code diagnosis of the identifier filter is recorded separately; this is not evidence that Flash could not interpret the source passages, because they never reached generation.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study reported that Ga-LTP-02 showed superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and localized LGR5-positive tumors effectively.

  Evidence `pubmed:42000453:0`:

  > Among them, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors.

## VMG-011

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "MRI examinations of 500 men with suspected csPCa from four European centers were included." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The AI system triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%; 95% CI: 173, 216) examinations with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "Conclusion Triaging by this AI system improved simulated diagnostic workflow efficiency without compromising diagnostic accuracy for csPCa." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "The model also demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy with Dice coefficients of 0.918-0.925 compared to traditional methods (0.795-0.811)." [PMID:42023157]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: AUC values for AI-assisted workflow. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Reader accuracy metrics beyond sensitivity/specificity. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Reader accuracy comparison between AI-assisted and unassisted readings.

**Source-first decision**

The required prostate and breast changes, comparators, intervals and source-specific sample roles are preserved. The extra AI-triaged subgroup metrics and Dice ranges also match the sources. However, it invents requirements for unrequested AUC/accuracy metrics and renders three poorly scoped gaps after two regeneration cycles; the final partial label is wrong for this complete question. These extra requirements and ambiguous gap wording are recorded as presentation/control defects, not an invented clinical outcome.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: In simulated prostate-MRI triage, the AI pathway maintained sensitivity at 89.0% while increasing specificity by 11.5 percentage points to 69.2% versus the conventional pathway.

What discrimination, sensitivity, and specificity did the catheter-related-thrombosis nomogram report in the oncology cohort?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "A nomogram integrating these variables demonstrated good discrimination (area under the curve = 0.866, 95% CI: 0.837-0.895), with a sensitivity of 70.33% and a specificity of 85.89%." [PMID:42077124]. The study reports: "Background: In this single-center retrospective study, the authors evaluated whether real-time ultrasound-guided positioning of an implantable venous access port catheter tip at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction (SVC-RAJ) reduces the risk of catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in adult patients with cancer and developed a multivariable risk prediction model to support individualized prevention.Methods: Clinical data from 600 consecutive patients who underwent port implantation at Zhongshan People's Hospital were analyzed." [PMID:42077124].

**Source-first decision**

The nomogram AUC, confidence interval, sensitivity and specificity match the original passage. The retrospective 600-patient context is accurate; the answer does not confuse discrimination with evidence of clinical benefit from the prediction model.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

**Source-first decision**

The required sensitivity and specificity tradeoff, p values and source comparators are correct.

**Source-first decision**

This independently generated answer is text-identical to the Pro refusal: it withholds the requested biopsy/patient-outcome benefit versus radiologist-only care. The source was retrieved. It is a correct refusal with a named outcome gap, although the generated question-shaped template gives little explanation of the simulation design.

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Traditional MRI methodologies require full k-space information, which follows a unique data acquisition sequence to reconstruct the complete image." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "This process presents a time-consuming obstacle for medical imaging techniques." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Our study proposes a novel image reconstruction method to enhance the efficiency of data acquisition while maintaining high accuracy in activation detection." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "The through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques are combined to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme are used to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage." [PMID:41951145]. The fMRI acceleration method reported that by applying the approach to simulated and experimental fMRI data, it successfully reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI). Compared with conventional reconstruction strategies, the method demonstrated potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Three unbiased anisotropic diffusion filtering models with optimized parameters for Rician noise removing in MR images.." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "Due to the inherent correlation between Rice's noise and the Magnetic Resonance (MR) signal that occurs during the MR images formation, denoising these images is an important but complex process, as it can prove insufficient and even result in the loss of information details." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "In fact, in order to denoise MR images with high Rice's noise levels, we propose adapted filtering anisotropic diffusion PDE filter models by using precise local parameters adjustment." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "The various tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to some other published methods, thus demonstrating the high performance of the proposed filters in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details." [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

The answer correctly distinguishes acquisition-time acceleration from Rician-noise denoising. It retains through/in-plane acceleration, image shifts, 2D Hadamard encoding, simulated/experimental validation and SNR/CNR, plus adaptive anisotropic diffusion, the noise estimator, PSO and synthetic/real-image validation. No head-to-head superiority is invented. Extensive background/source quotations make the answer longer than needed.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

For surveillance of local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence, what sensitivities were reported for nasopharyngeal-brush versus plasma EBV DNA testing?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%)." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "The value of nasopharyngeal brush versus plasma EBV DNA detection in diagnosing local recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.." [PMID:41631491].

**Source-first decision**

The two requested sensitivities, additional specificities and cohort size match the study. The title quotation is redundant but does not change the meaning or add an unsupported conclusion.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "A total of 241 patients were included." [PMID:41644509]. This was a multicenter cross-sectional study that measured AV access flow and LVMI simultaneously at a single time point, which cannot establish that lowering access flow improves cardiac outcomes because cross-sectional observational designs only demonstrate association at one time point and cannot determine temporal sequence or causal direction [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024." [PMID:41644509]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Study design limitation preventing causal inference that lowering access flow improves cardiac outcomes.

**Source-first decision**

Association estimate, confidence interval, p value and nonsignificant dialysis-vintage contrast match the source. The non-causal interpretation of the cross-sectional design is appropriate. Two additional statements are not supported: the abstract does not specify that flow and LVMI were measured simultaneously, and the final gap denies an established design limitation even after the answer explains it. The latter is a contradictory evidence-absence statement, not just a partial badge. Neither the study design nor the gold rubric requires exact simultaneity.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with AVB." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "After adjusting for all factors considered, maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "A total of 3455 vaginal births were included: 3090 spontaneous vaginal births and 365 AVB." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "A secondary analysis compared maternal and neonatal outcomes between perineal and mid/low cavity vacuum applications." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic applications were associated with greater blood loss (p < 0.01), higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01)." [PMID:42036403]. A secondary analysis (subgroup analysis) compared maternal and neonatal outcomes between perineal and mid/low‑cavity vacuum applications [PMID:42036403]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Comparative results for mid/low-pelvic versus perineal applications: success rates.

The retrieved evidence does not establish: Comparative results for mid/low-pelvic versus perineal applications: neonatal complications. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Subgroup or sensitivity analyses for pelvic application site comparison.

**Source-first decision**

All required adjusted factors, directions, effect estimates and application-site contrasts are accurately quoted. The final answer additionally calls the pelvic comparison a subgroup analysis, then says subgroup or sensitivity analyses for that same comparison are not established. Count this contradictory evidence-absence statement as one material addition conservatively; the unreported success/failure/neonatal endpoints are separate unrequested requirements, not invented outcome values. Partial labeling and repeated gaps impair the final answer.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, what did online adaptation change in target coverage and organ-at-risk dose, and what treatment-time and toxicity results were reported?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Online adaptation significantly improved target coverage (median V100% change: +0.1%±2.5%) compared to predicted plans (-2.6%±7.3%, p < 0.001), without significant differences in OAR doses." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "A total of 41 patients were enrolled, receiving 232 fractions, of which 178 (76.7%) were treated with ASRT." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "Median total treatment time was 28 min, with an average 5-minute ASRT workflow." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "No grade ≥ 3 toxicities were reported; grade 2 events occurred in 10.3% of patients." [PMID:42058324]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: the treatment-time results for online adaptation versus standard planning.

**Source-first decision**

Target-coverage changes versus predicted plans, lack of significant OAR-dose difference, median 28-minute treatment, mean 5-minute workflow and toxicity grades/frequency all match the source. The added gap asks for an unrequested treatment-time comparison with standard planning, which the source indeed does not provide. This produces a wrong partial label, but unlike denying a reported result it does not contradict a source fact.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Online adaptation improved median V100% target coverage relative to predicted plans (+0.1%±2.5% vs -2.6%±7.3%; P<0.001) without a significant OAR-dose difference.

  Evidence `pubmed:42058324:0`:

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the required comparative data for: Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

This independently generated final refusal matches Pro verbatim. It correctly identifies missing comparative data for local control/survival versus nonadaptive treatment without denying the single-cohort follow-up outcomes.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
