In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, what cardiac MRI findings in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans at Providence VA Medical Center, cardiac MRI findings of increased extracellular volume and lower right heart function among 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years) compared to 20 controls (mean age 56 years) suggested the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Correct MRI direction, 21/20 population and cautious interpretation. Full cohort quotation partly repeats the prose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Compared with controls, veterans with HIV had increased myocardial extracellular volume and lower right-heart function on MRI; the authors said these findings suggested increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

In the single-arm DYNAMITE study, what structural changes were measured at 9 months and what major adverse cardiac events were observed by 24 months after DynamX implantation?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the DYNAMITE study, optical coherence tomography at 9 months showed significant structural changes: mean device area increased from 8.15 ± 0.64 mm² postprocedure to 8.53 ± 1.71 mm² (absolute change: 0.37 ± 0.99 mm²; relative change: 5.52 ± 14.8%, p = 0.010), while mean in-device lumen area decreased from 8.27 ± 1.78 mm² to 7.57 ± 1.86 mm² (absolute change: -0.70 ± 1.09 mm²; relative change: -7.98 ± 14.9%, p < 0.001), demonstrating positive vessel remodeling with device expansion and lumen reduction due to scaffold absorption [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "A total of 55 patients (55 lesions) were enrolled." [PMID:41765253]. At 24-month follow-up, 4 patients (7.4%) experienced major adverse cardiac events, consisting of one target vessel myocardial infarction and four target lesion revascularization events [PMID:41765253].

**Source-first decision**

Structural changes and event counts are correct, but the added explanation that lumen reduction was due to scaffold absorption has no basis in the supplied source. Count one unsupported mechanism.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: From postprocedure to 9 months, mean device area increased by 0.37 mm² (P=0.010), while mean in-device lumen area decreased by 0.70 mm² (P<0.001).

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

The pilot study found increased extracellular volume on cardiac MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis. The study included 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black). Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations [PMID:41791688]. The pilot study demonstrated lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, indicating decreased right ventricular function [PMID:41791688]. The study highlights the need for larger longitudinal studies to better understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes, which remains an unanswered question [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

MRI findings, sample sizes and longitudinal boundary are correct, but the required elevated GDF-15 finding is omitted. The complete coverage label also conflicts with the unanswered longitudinal outcome.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

  > We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population.

Required evidence boundary: The cross-sectional pilot does not show the trajectory of cardiac changes or whether HIV causes them; larger longitudinal evidence is missing.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

In dynamic PET imaging, [^68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 demonstrated significantly higher uptake in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) compared with LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL). The tumor-to-muscle ratio was correspondingly elevated in the A549 model (4.07 ± 0.07) versus the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10). Biodistribution studies confirmed specific targeting of LGR5-positive tumors, with [^68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibiting superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and effectively localizing LGR5-positive tumors [PMID:42000453]. Cellular uptake assays showed markedly higher accumulation of both [^68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 and [^18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 in Nectin4-positive MC38-Nectin4 cells compared with Nectin4-negative MC38 cells. Biodistribution and PET imaging revealed pronounced specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, while uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower. The tumor-to-muscle ratio increased progressively over time, reaching maximum at 120 minutes post-injection. [^68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 demonstrated consistently higher tumor uptake than [^18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined, with both probes showing high target specificity for Nectin4-expressing tumors [PMID:41916034].

What sensitivity-specificity tradeoff did simulated prostate-MRI AI triage show, and what real-world clinical effect remains untested?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the simulation study of 400 test patients, the AI-driven triage pathway maintained comparable sensitivity to radiologists (89.0% vs 89.4%, P=0.36) while improving specificity by 11.5 percentage points, from 57.7% to 69.2% (P<0.001). For the 195 examinations (49%) that the AI system directly triaged and diagnosed, it achieved sensitivity of 94.7% and specificity of 94.7% [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1)."

[PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "MRI examinations of 500 men with suspected csPCa from four European centers were included." [PMID:41960994]. The simulation study evaluated diagnostic accuracy metrics (sensitivity and specificity) but did not test whether the AI-driven workflow improves actual clinical outcomes or alters patient management in real-world practice. The study was conducted as a simulation on historical examinations rather than a prospective clinical implementation, so the effect on real-world diagnostic workflow efficiency and patient outcomes remains untested [PMID:41960994].

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The fMRI acceleration method addressed the time-consuming problem of traditional MRI that requires full k-space information for image reconstruction, proposing a Bayesian 2D acceleration approach combining through-plane and in-plane techniques with multiple image-shift strategies and 2D Hadamard encoding to accelerate acquisition while maintaining activation detection accuracy [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme are used to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage." [PMID:41951145]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters addressed the problem of Rician noise in MR images, which complicates denoising and can result in insufficient noise reduction or loss of information details, by proposing adapted filtering anisotropic diffusion PDE filter models with precise local parameters adjustment using a robust Rician noise estimator and optimized parameters through the PSO algorithm [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "Due to the inherent correlation between Rice's noise and the Magnetic Resonance (MR) signal that occurs during the MR images formation, denoising these images is an important but complex process, as it can prove insufficient and even result in the loss of information details." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "To overcome these two drawbacks, filtering methods based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have been introduced, but the parameters of the filters they propose must be determined with great accuracy." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663]. The fMRI acceleration method validation reported that applying the approach to both simulated and experimental fMRI data successfully reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI), demonstrating potential improvements in activation detection compared with conventional reconstruction strategies [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Compared with conventional reconstruction strategies, the proposed method demonstrates potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions, while also providing voxel-wise estimates through a Bayesian framework." [PMID:41951145]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters validation reported that tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to other published methods, demonstrating high performance in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

Both methods, validation findings and data-type conditions are correct, but repeated source paragraphs make the response long.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

For surveillance of local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence, what sensitivities were reported for nasopharyngeal-brush versus plasma EBV DNA testing?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a study of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.7% for detecting local recurrence, compared to a sensitivity of 61.4% for plasma EBV DNA testing [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%)." [PMID:41631491].

**Source-first decision**

Both test-specific sensitivities are correct. A following source quotation repeats the comparison.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

In this multicenter cross-sectional study of 241 hemodialysis patients, higher arteriovenous access flow (FV) was significantly associated with increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), with a mean difference of 22.83 (95% CI: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046). LVMI was used as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular morbidity [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The study cannot establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes because it employed a cross-sectional observational design, which can only demonstrate an association between access flow and LVMI but cannot establish that modifying access flow would change cardiac outcomes. Cross-sectional studies do not follow patients longitudinally or test interventions, and therefore cannot establish causality or the effect of intervening on the exposure [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024." [PMID:41644509].

**Source-first decision**

Association, uncertainty, null dialysis-vintage contrast and source-derived observational causal limit are retained. The explanation now avoids a claim of simultaneous measurements; general design limitations are accepted as the gold-derived claim requires.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort of 3455 vaginal births (365 AVB and 3090 spontaneous vaginal births), multivariable logistic regression identified maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) as factors positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated with AVB [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low-pelvic vacuum applications were associated with greater blood loss (p < 0.01), a higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01) [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All six adjusted factors and both application-group contrasts match the frozen evidence.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Older maternal age, mode of conception, epidural analgesia, later gestational age, and male newborn sex were positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, whereas parity was inversely associated.

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, what did online adaptation change in target coverage and organ-at-risk dose, and what treatment-time and toxicity results were reported?

**Saved Agent answer**

Online adaptation significantly improved target coverage (median V100% change: +0.1%±2.5%) compared to predicted plans (-2.6%±7.3%, p < 0.001), without significant differences in organ-at-risk doses; the study enrolled 41 patients receiving 232 fractions, of which 178 (76.7%) were treated with ASRT [PMID:42058324]. Median total treatment time was 28 minutes, with an average 5‑minute ASRT workflow, and no grade ≥3 toxicities were reported while grade 2 events occurred in 10.3% of patients [PMID:42058324].

**Source-first decision**

Correct dosimetry, source population, treatment time and toxicity without a survival-comparator claim.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Online adaptation improved median V100% target coverage relative to predicted plans (+0.1%±2.5% vs -2.6%±7.3%; P<0.001) without a significant OAR-dose difference.

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the comparative data needed to establish that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

Correct comparative evidence boundary without falsely denying observed single-arm outcomes.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
