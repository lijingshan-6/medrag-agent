In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, what cardiac MRI findings in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, cardiac MRI findings of increased extracellular volume and lower right heart function in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

MRI direction, matched 21/20 population and source-supported interpretation are preserved. Repeated findings and full demographic quotation are unnecessary.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Compared with controls, veterans with HIV had increased myocardial extracellular volume and lower right-heart function on MRI; the authors said these findings suggested increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

In the single-arm DYNAMITE study, what structural changes were measured at 9 months and what major adverse cardiac events were observed by 24 months after DynamX implantation?

**Saved Agent answer**

At 9‑month follow‑up in the 55‑patient (55 lesions) DYNAMITE cohort, mean device area increased to 8.53 ± 1.71 mm² (absolute change 0.37 ± 0.99 mm², relative increase 5.52 ± 14.8%, p = 0.010), while mean in‑device lumen area decreased to 7.57 ± 1.86 mm² (absolute change –0.70 ± 1.09 mm², relative decrease –7.98 ± 14.9%, p < 0.001) [PMID:41765253]. At 24‑month follow‑up, 4 patients (7.4%) experienced major adverse cardiac events, consisting of one target‑vessel myocardial infarction and four target‑lesion revascularization events [PMID:41765253].

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a cross-sectional pilot study of 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years), veterans with HIV showed higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels and increased extracellular volume on cardiac MRI, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis in this population [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. The same study found lower right heart function on cardiac MRI among patients with HIV compared to controls, indicating decreased right ventricular function associated with HIV [PMID:41791688]. The authors note that larger longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes, which remains an unanswered question [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Supported pilot findings and explicit unanswered longitudinal trajectory. The complete evidence label conflicts with the requested unmeasured longitudinal outcome.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

  > We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population.

Required evidence boundary: The cross-sectional pilot does not show the trajectory of cardiac changes or whether HIV causes them; larger longitudinal evidence is missing.

## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules." [PMID:42023157]. SCAR-Net was validated through multicenter validation involving the same four-hospital dataset [PMID:42023157]. SCAR-Net increased radiologist AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001) [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

Development scale, architecture and reader metrics are correct. The added statement that multicenter validation involved the same four-hospital dataset is not established by the abstract; conservatively count one unsupported population-identity claim.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: SCAR-Net was developed from 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients at four hospitals and used scar-recurrence feature-enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention modules.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [^68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) than in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL), with corresponding tumor-to-muscle ratios of 4.07 ± 0.07 versus 0.77 ± 0.10, respectively. Biodistribution studies confirmed specific targeting of LGR5-positive tumors [PMID:42000453]. Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both [^68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 and [^18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 tracers in Nectin4-positive MC38-Nectin4 cells compared with Nectin4-negative MC38 cells. Biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, with tumor-to-muscle ratios increasing progressively to maximum at 120 minutes post-injection [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

LGR5 positive/negative xenograft localization is supported and each tracer remains attached to its own study. Nectin4 reports positive-versus-negative cellular uptake but omits the required lower uptake in control tumors in vivo; count one missing comparison qualifier. Cellular controls cannot substitute for the tumor-control comparison.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study reported that Ga-LTP-02 showed superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and localized LGR5-positive tumors effectively.

  Evidence `pubmed:42000453:0`:

  > Among them, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors.

- **C2**: The second study found that the tracer accumulated specifically in Nectin4-expressing tumor models, with lower uptake in non-targeted tumors.

  Evidence `pubmed:41916034:0`:

  > In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower.

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow testing 400 patients (median age 66 years; IQR 60-69 years), radiologists without AI assistance achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1). The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity at 89.0% (95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5% to 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001). The AI system independently triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%) examinations with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9), using data from 500 men with suspected clinically significant prostate cancer from four European centers and incorporating assessments from 62 radiologists [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157].

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The fMRI acceleration method addressed the problem that traditional MRI requires full k-space information for image reconstruction, which is a time-consuming obstacle for medical imaging. The method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions, using multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage [PMID:41951145]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters addressed the problem of denoising MR images corrupted by Rician noise, which is complex because it can prove insufficient and result in loss of information details. The method proposed adapted anisotropic diffusion PDE filter models with precise local parameters adjustment, incorporating a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of anisotropic diffusion filters whose parameters are calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the PSO algorithm using quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, and BRISQUE) [PMID:41903663]. For the fMRI acceleration method, validation on simulated and experimental fMRI data showed reduced total scan time while achieving higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI), with potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions. For the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters, validation tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to other published methods, demonstrating high performance in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details [PMID:41951145] [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

Both mechanisms and findings retain simulated/experimental and synthetic/real validation conditions, without ranking the methods against one another.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

For surveillance of local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence, what sensitivities were reported for nasopharyngeal-brush versus plasma EBV DNA testing?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a study of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.7% for detecting local recurrence, which was significantly higher than the 61.4% sensitivity reported for plasma EBV DNA testing [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%)." [PMID:41631491].

**Source-first decision**

Both sensitivities and their correct tests are reported; repeated quotation adds supported specificity but repeats the requested finding.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Nasopharyngeal-brush EBV DNA testing had 95.7% sensitivity versus 61.4% for plasma EBV DNA testing.

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a multicenter cross-sectional study of 241 hemodialysis patients, higher AV access flow (brachial artery flow volume) was significantly associated with increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), with a mean difference of 22.83 (95% CI: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046) in multivariate regression analysis [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024." [PMID:41644509].

**Source-first decision**

Association and null dialysis-vintage contrast retain uncertainty. C2 is absent: quoting the cross-sectional design does not explain why lowering flow has no established causal benefit. Rejected timing prose was removed, but its binding issue was overwritten by quotation recovery.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort of 3455 vaginal births (3090 spontaneous vaginal births and 365 assisted vaginal births), multivariable logistic regression identified the following factors as independently associated with assisted vaginal birth: maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated with AVB [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic vacuum applications were associated with greater maternal morbidity, including greater blood loss (p < 0.01), a higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use during delivery (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01) [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All six adjusted predictors with ORs/CIs and pelvic-versus-perineal comparisons are correctly preserved.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Older maternal age, mode of conception, epidural analgesia, later gestational age, and male newborn sex were positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, whereas parity was inversely associated.

## VMG-039

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, what did online adaptation change in target coverage and organ-at-risk dose, and what treatment-time and toxicity results were reported?

**Saved Agent answer**

Online adaptation significantly improved target coverage (median V100% change: +0.1%±2.5%) compared to predicted plans (-2.6%±7.3%, p < 0.001), without significant differences in OAR doses [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "A total of 41 patients were enrolled, receiving 232 fractions, of which 178 (76.7%) were treated with ASRT." [PMID:42058324]. Median total treatment time was 28 minutes, with an average 5-minute ASRT workflow. No grade ≥ 3 toxicities were reported; grade 2 events occurred in 10.3% of patients [PMID:42058324].

**Source-first decision**

Correct target coverage comparison, absent significant OAR difference, workflow time, treatment time and grade-specific toxicity.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Online adaptation improved median V100% target coverage relative to predicted plans (+0.1%±2.5% vs -2.6%±7.3%; P<0.001) without a significant OAR-dose difference.

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the comparative data needed to establish that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly refuses comparative local-control/survival benefit without a nonadaptive control; does not deny reported single-arm outcomes.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
