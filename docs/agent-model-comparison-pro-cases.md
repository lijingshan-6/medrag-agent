## VMG-001

In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, what cardiac MRI findings in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We conducted a cross-sectional pilot study of matched veterans with and without HIV receiving care at the Providence VA Medical Center to explore the relationship between systemic inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, and subclinical cardiac disease in HIV." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Participants were extensively phenotyped with questionnaires, physical exam, stress test, echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, coronary calcium score, and blood measurement of markers of inflammation and fibrosis." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function." [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

The cited HIV pilot supports increased extracellular volume and lower right-heart function, with cautious pilot/association wording preserved. All additional sentences match the source. Coverage is complete; the lengthy methods and demographic quotations exceed what the MRI-finding question needs.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Compared with controls, veterans with HIV had increased myocardial extracellular volume and lower right-heart function on MRI; the authors said these findings suggested increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

## VMG-002

In the single-arm DYNAMITE study, what structural changes were measured at 9 months and what major adverse cardiac events were observed by 24 months after DynamX implantation?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "The primary co-endpoints were the difference in mean device area and mean in-device lumen area from postprocedure to 9 months as measured by optical coherence tomography." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "Postprocedural mean device area was 8.15 ± 0.64 mm2, and in-device lumen area 8.27±1.78 mm2." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 9-month follow-up, mean device area increased to 8.53 ± 1.71 mm2 (absolute difference: 0.37 ± 0.99 mm²; relative difference: 5.52 ± 14.8%, p = 0.010), and mean in-device lumen area decreased to 7.57 ± 1.86 mm2 (absolute difference: -0.70 ± 1.09 mm²; relative difference: -7.98 ± 14.9%, p <0.001)." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "A total of 55 patients (55 lesions) were enrolled." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 24-month follow-up, 4 patients (7.4%) experienced major adverse cardiac events, including one target vessel myocardial infarction and 4 target lesion revascularization events." [PMID:41765253].

**Source-first decision**

The answer preserves baseline and nine-month device/lumen areas, absolute/relative changes and p values, plus four patients with MACE and the separate event counts at 24 months. All numbers match the single-arm source; no comparator benefit is inferred.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: From postprocedure to 9 months, mean device area increased by 0.37 mm² (P=0.010), while mean in-device lumen area decreased by 0.70 mm² (P<0.001).

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. The authors stated that the study highlights the need for larger longitudinal studies to better understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes and help improve cardiac disease prevention in this population, leaving the longitudinal trajectory of HIV-associated myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction unanswered [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Findings, 21 versus 20 participants, and cautious association language match the pilot. The answer explicitly leaves the longitudinal trajectory unanswered and calls for larger longitudinal studies. Content passes; the complete coverage label disagrees with the benchmark partial-evidence contract, but the prose does not invent the missing trajectory.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population.

Required evidence boundary: The cross-sectional pilot does not show the trajectory of cardiac changes or whether HIV causes them; larger longitudinal evidence is missing.

## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "This study introduces SCAR-Net, a deep learning model specifically designed for ultrasound-based discrimination between these similar-appearing tissues." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "The model also demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy with Dice coefficients of 0.918-0.925 compared to traditional methods (0.795-0.811)." [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

The answer separates the development dataset (34,376 images, 5,710 patients, four hospitals) from the multicenter reader-performance results, preserves both architecture modules and all AUC/sensitivity/specificity ranges, and accurately quotes the additional Dice comparison. It does not relabel the development cohort as a validation denominator or claim demonstrated biopsy reduction.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: SCAR-Net was developed from 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients at four hospitals and used scar-recurrence feature-enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention modules.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) than in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Consistently, the tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 xenograft model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Moreover, biodistribution studies further confirmed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 can specifically target LGR5-positive tumors." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Among them, [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both tracers in MC38-Nectin4 cells (Nectin4+) compared with MC38 cells (Nectin4-negative, Nectin4-)." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio increased progressively over time and reached its maximum at 120 min post-injection (p.i.)." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "Moreover, tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 was consistently higher than that of [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined." [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

The LGR5 and Nectin4 findings are attributed to their respective papers. Xenograft/cell-model language is retained. The uptake numbers, tumor-to-muscle ratios, time point and within-Nectin4 radiolabel comparison all match the retrieved sources. The answer does not compare the two targets head-to-head or infer patient efficacy.

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The AI system triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%; 95% CI: 173, 216) examinations with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "MRI examinations of 500 men with suspected csPCa from four European centers were included." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules."

The retrieved evidence does not establish: Noted limitations of AI-assisted versus unassisted reading in the breast-ultrasound scar/recurrence study.

**Source-first decision**

Both studies retain their correct radiologist comparators, performance estimates, intervals and p values. The 400-patient prostate test subset is separate from the 500 included men; breast counts are explicitly development data. The question supplies the simulated setting and the answer makes no claim of live clinical benefit or cross-study superiority. Extra unrequested limitations are turned into false partial-coverage gaps.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

What discrimination, sensitivity, and specificity did the catheter-related-thrombosis nomogram report in the oncology cohort?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Background: In this single-center retrospective study, the authors evaluated whether real-time ultrasound-guided positioning of an implantable venous access port catheter tip at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction (SVC-RAJ) reduces the risk of catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in adult patients with cancer and developed a multivariable risk prediction model to support individualized prevention.Methods: Clinical data from 600 consecutive patients who underwent port implantation at Zhongshan People's Hospital were analyzed." [PMID:42077124]. The study reports: "A nomogram integrating these variables demonstrated good discrimination (area under the curve = 0.866, 95% CI: 0.837-0.895), with a sensitivity of 70.33% and a specificity of 85.89%." [PMID:42077124].

**Source-first decision**

AUC 0.866 with its 0.837-0.895 interval, sensitivity 70.33% and specificity 85.89% match the source. The added 600-patient retrospective-study context is accurate and describes an investigation, not proof that using the nomogram reduces thrombosis.

The retrieved evidence does not establish: Prospective clinical effects of deploying the AI triaging pathway in real practice on actual workflow, turnaround, and patient outcomes.

**Source-first decision**

Sensitivity, specificity, comparisons, confidence intervals and p values match the source. The study is explicitly simulated and retrospective; the final gap correctly withholds prospective deployment/workflow/patient-outcome claims. The answer is unnecessarily long, reproducing most of the abstract after the requested tradeoff is already stated.

## VMG-014

Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide outcome data establishing: Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow.

**Source-first decision**

The answer refuses to claim biopsy reduction or improved patient outcomes versus radiologist-only care and identifies those exact missing outcomes. The requested source was retrieved. This is a supported evidence-boundary refusal, not proof that no patient follow-up existed. The terse question-shaped wording is less useful than an explanation of the simulated design.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: The simulation reports sensitivity, specificity, and examinations triaged but no prospective comparison of biopsy use, treatment, morbidity, or patient outcomes.

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Traditional MRI methodologies require full k-space information, which follows a unique data acquisition sequence to reconstruct the complete image." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "This process presents a time-consuming obstacle for medical imaging techniques." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Our study proposes a novel image reconstruction method to enhance the efficiency of data acquisition while maintaining high accuracy in activation detection." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "The through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques are combined to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme are used to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage." [PMID:41951145]. Applied to both simulated and experimental fMRI data, the proposed method successfully reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI), and, compared with conventional reconstruction strategies, demonstrated potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions while providing voxel-wise estimates through a Bayesian framework [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Three unbiased anisotropic diffusion filtering models with optimized parameters for Rician noise removing in MR images.." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "Due to the inherent correlation between Rice's noise and the Magnetic Resonance (MR) signal that occurs during the MR images formation, denoising these images is an important but complex process, as it can prove insufficient and even result in the loss of information details." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "In fact, in order to denoise MR images with high Rice's noise levels, we propose adapted filtering anisotropic diffusion PDE filter models by using precise local parameters adjustment." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "The various tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to some other published methods, thus demonstrating the high performance of the proposed filters in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details." [PMID:41903663]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Validation result reported for the anisotropic-diffusion filters.

**Source-first decision**

Both required method/validation findings are present and correctly cited. However, the final sentence asserts that the retrieved evidence does not establish a validation result for the diffusion filters, directly contradicting the quoted synthetic/real-image validation immediately above it and the frozen source. This is one unsupported/contradictory material evidence-absence statement, not merely a wrong status badge. The long background quotations also reduce readability.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

## VMG-024

For surveillance of local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence, what sensitivities were reported for nasopharyngeal-brush versus plasma EBV DNA testing?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%)." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "These findings suggest that EBV DNA detection in nasopharyngeal brush samples is a highly sensitive and minimally invasive supplementary tool for monitoring NPC recurrence." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "The positive predictive value was similar between methods, whereas the negative predictive value was markedly higher for the nasopharyngeal brush group (97.3% vs. 80.7%)." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "This approach offers superior sensitivity and an improved negative predictive value compared to plasma EBV DNA testing, and may enhance early surveillance and clinical management of NPC recurrence." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Head and neck MRI, sinus endoscopy examination, and biopsy of suspicious lesions were used as the gold standard to confirm recurrence." [PMID:41631491].

**Source-first decision**

Brush sensitivity 95.7% and plasma sensitivity 61.4% are correctly assigned. All added specificity, negative-predictive-value, cohort and reference-standard statements match the source, and potential clinical usefulness remains qualified. Most of these extra quotations are unnecessary for a two-number question.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "AV access flow was quantified as brachial artery flow volume (FV) using pulsed Doppler ultrasonography." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "The mean FV was 0.71 ± 0.29 L/min, and the median dialysis vintage was 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.0-11.0 years)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "A total of 241 patients were included." [PMID:41644509]. The study was a multicenter cross-sectional study that enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow between April 2014 and January 2024, and applied multivariate regression models to investigate the associations of FV and dialysis vintage with LVMI; because the analysis was cross-sectional and observational rather than interventional, it cannot demonstrate that reducing AV access flow causes LV mass regression [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Multivariate regression models were applied to investigate the associations of FV and dialysis vintage with LVMI, and to assess potential interactions between these variables." [PMID:41644509]. The authors note that whether AV access blood flow and dialysis vintage have independent or interactive effects on cardiac outcomes remains unclear; although higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI while dialysis vintage was not, no statistically significant interaction between FV and dialysis vintage was observed (mean difference = 0.13; 95% CI: -3.14 to 3.40; p = 0.94), which limits causal inference from the reported cross-sectional association [PMID:41644509]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: prospective effects of lowering AV-access flow on LV mass regression, mortality, or heart failure hospitalization.

**Source-first decision**

The requested association, null dialysis-vintage contrast and correct cross-sectional/noninterventional explanation are present. The answer additionally links the nonsignificant flow-by-vintage interaction to limited causal inference ("which limits causal inference"). That rationale is not established by the source: lack of a statistically significant interaction is distinct from the design limitation. Count one unsupported explanatory addition conservatively; the earlier correct design explanation does not erase it. The requested why-causality-is-unproven question is complete under the gold contract, so the extra prospective-outcome component also produces a label mismatch.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:41644509:0`:

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with AVB." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "After adjusting for all factors considered, maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "A total of 3455 vaginal births were included: 3090 spontaneous vaginal births and 365 AVB." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "A secondary analysis compared maternal and neonatal outcomes between perineal and mid/low cavity vacuum applications." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic applications were associated with greater blood loss (p < 0.01), higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01)." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "Mid/low cavity applications showed greater maternal morbidity than perineal applications, underscoring the importance of careful case selection and procedural planning." [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

Final answer preserves all six adjusted association directions and odds ratios/intervals, keeps mode of conception unspecified, and correctly reports the mid/low versus perineal blood-loss, episiotomy and ultrasound-use contrasts with p values. The cohort and procedural-planning sentence match the original retrospective report. One regeneration occurred; only this retained final answer is scored.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, what did online adaptation change in target coverage and organ-at-risk dose, and what treatment-time and toxicity results were reported?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Online adaptation significantly improved target coverage (median V100% change: +0.1%±2.5%) compared to predicted plans (-2.6%±7.3%, p < 0.001), without significant differences in OAR doses." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "A total of 41 patients were enrolled, receiving 232 fractions, of which 178 (76.7%) were treated with ASRT." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "Median total treatment time was 28 min, with an average 5-minute ASRT workflow." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "No grade ≥ 3 toxicities were reported; grade 2 events occurred in 10.3% of patients." [PMID:42058324].

**Source-first decision**

The answer correctly preserves target-coverage change versus predicted plans, no significant OAR-dose difference, the median-versus-mean treatment/workflow times, and toxicity thresholds and frequency. The 41-patient/fraction context matches the source. It does not infer survival superiority from dosimetry.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Online adaptation improved median V100% target coverage relative to predicted plans (+0.1%±2.5% vs -2.6%±7.3%; P<0.001) without a significant OAR-dose difference.

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the required comparative data for: Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

The source was retrieved and the answer explicitly withholds a comparative local-control/survival conclusion because the required comparative data are absent. It does not claim those outcomes were never measured in the single cohort. This is a correct boundary refusal, although the final template provides little explanatory context.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
