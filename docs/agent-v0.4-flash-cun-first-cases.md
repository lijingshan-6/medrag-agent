## VMG-001

In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, what cardiac MRI findings in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "We conducted a cross-sectional pilot study of matched veterans with and without HIV receiving care at the Providence VA Medical Center to explore the relationship between systemic inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, and subclinical cardiac disease in HIV." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "This study highlights the need for larger longitudinal studies to better understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes and help improve cardiac disease prevention in this population." [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

The source quotations retain increased extracellular volume, lower right-heart MRI function and the suggestive rather than causal interpretation, with the 21/20 matched pilot population. Additional design and longitudinal-study quotations are supported but verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Compared with controls, veterans with HIV had increased myocardial extracellular volume and lower right-heart function on MRI; the authors said these findings suggested increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

## VMG-002

In the single-arm DYNAMITE study, what structural changes were measured at 9 months and what major adverse cardiac events were observed by 24 months after DynamX implantation?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "The primary co-endpoints were the difference in mean device area and mean in-device lumen area from postprocedure to 9 months as measured by optical coherence tomography." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "Postprocedural mean device area was 8.15 ± 0.64 mm2, and in-device lumen area 8.27±1.78 mm2." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 9-month follow-up, mean device area increased to 8.53 ± 1.71 mm2 (absolute difference: 0.37 ± 0.99 mm²; relative difference: 5.52 ± 14.8%, p = 0.010), and mean in-device lumen area decreased to 7.57 ± 1.86 mm2 (absolute difference: -0.70 ± 1.09 mm²; relative difference: -7.98 ± 14.9%, p <0.001)." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "A total of 55 patients (55 lesions) were enrolled." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 24-month follow-up, 4 patients (7.4%) experienced major adverse cardiac events, including one target vessel myocardial infarction and 4 target lesion revascularization events." [PMID:41765253].

**Source-first decision**

Exact source sentences retain both 9-month area changes with P values, and four patients with MACE at 24 months including the MI and revascularization events. No scaffold-absorption mechanism or comparator superiority is added.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: From postprocedure to 9 months, mean device area increased by 0.37 mm² (P=0.010), while mean in-device lumen area decreased by 0.70 mm² (P<0.001).

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "We conducted a cross-sectional pilot study of matched veterans with and without HIV receiving care at the Providence VA Medical Center to explore the relationship between systemic inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, and subclinical cardiac disease in HIV." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Participants were extensively phenotyped with questionnaires, physical exam, stress test, echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, coronary calcium score, and blood measurement of markers of inflammation and fibrosis." [PMID:41791688]. In the same pilot, patients with HIV had lower right heart function on MRI, suggesting subclinical myocardial dysfunction, and the authors reported that limited data from this pilot study suggest HIV may be associated with decreased right ventricular function [PMID:41791688]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: the longitudinal trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes over time.

**Source-first decision**

Retains GDF-15, extracellular volume, lower right-heart function, 21 HIV participants and 20 controls, and cross-sectional design. The explicit gap correctly withholds a longitudinal trajectory. The right-heart finding is repeated and phenotyping detail is unnecessary.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population.

Required evidence boundary: The cross-sectional pilot does not show the trajectory of cardiac changes or whether HIV causes them; larger longitudinal evidence is missing.

## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "This study introduces SCAR-Net, a deep learning model specifically designed for ultrasound-based discrimination between these similar-appearing tissues." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "The model also demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy with Dice coefficients of 0.918-0.925 compared to traditional methods (0.795-0.811)." [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

The development sample and architecture are quoted separately from the reported multicenter validation metrics, with exact before/after AUC, sensitivity and specificity. No shared or separate validation cohort is invented; segmentation is supported but additional.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: SCAR-Net was developed from 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients at four hospitals and used scar-recurrence feature-enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention modules.

  Evidence `pubmed:42023157:0`:

  > Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules.

- **C2**: With SCAR-Net assistance, radiologist AUC rose from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) than in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Consistently, the tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 xenograft model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Moreover, biodistribution studies further confirmed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 can specifically target LGR5-positive tumors." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio increased progressively over time and reached its maximum at 120 min post-injection (p.i.)." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "Moreover, tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 was consistently higher than that of [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined." [PMID:41916034]. The study reports: "Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both tracers in MC38-Nectin4 cells (Nectin4+) compared with MC38 cells (Nectin4-negative, Nectin4-)." [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

LGR5-positive versus negative xenograft uptake and tumor-to-muscle contrast support the requested target-specific localization. The Nectin4 tumor comparison explicitly retains lower MC38 uptake. Both studies are cited separately; there is no head-to-head or patient-accuracy claim. Additional cell and timing detail is supported but not needed.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study reported that Ga-LTP-02 showed superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and localized LGR5-positive tumors effectively.

  Evidence `pubmed:42000453:0`:

  > Among them, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors.

- **C2**: The second study found that the tracer accumulated specifically in Nectin4-expressing tumor models, with lower uptake in non-targeted tumors.

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001)." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "MRI examinations of 500 men with suspected csPCa from four European centers were included." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "The workflow was simulated on 400 examinations, including examinations from an external site, incorporating assessments from 62 radiologists." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "Materials and Methods Data from an international AI confirmatory study (February 2022-November 2023) were used in this retrospective study." [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)."

[PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

Both named studies are correctly separated: simulated retrospective prostate triage preserves comparable sensitivity and improved specificity; breast-ultrasound multicenter validation preserves all before/after metrics. The development sample is not assigned an invented validation partition. Additional design sentences make the answer verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: In simulated prostate-MRI triage, the AI pathway maintained sensitivity at 89.0% while increasing specificity by 11.5 percentage points to 69.2% versus the conventional pathway.

  Evidence `pubmed:41960994:0`:

What discrimination, sensitivity, and specificity did the catheter-related-thrombosis nomogram report in the oncology cohort?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "A nomogram integrating these variables demonstrated good discrimination (area under the curve = 0.866, 95% CI: 0.837-0.895), with a sensitivity of 70.33% and a specificity of 85.89%." [PMID:42077124]. The study reports: "Background: In this single-center retrospective study, the authors evaluated whether real-time ultrasound-guided positioning of an implantable venous access port catheter tip at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction (SVC-RAJ) reduces the risk of catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in adult patients with cancer and developed a multivariable risk prediction model to support individualized prevention.Methods: Clinical data from 600 consecutive patients who underwent port implantation at Zhongshan People's Hospital were analyzed." [PMID:42077124]. The study reports: "Performance across specific age or BMI strata was not separately evaluated in this study, and further stratified validation in larger datasets is needed to assess model consistency across demographic subgroups.Conclusions: These findings support ultrasound-guided SVC-RAJ positioning as a clinically relevant strategy for reducing CRT risk and maintaining reliable venous access in contemporary oncology care pathways." [PMID:42077124].

**Source-first decision**

The nomogram AUC, confidence interval, sensitivity and specificity match the frozen abstract. The retrospective design and authors conclusion are explicitly quoted, with no prospective efficacy claim about the nomogram. Background and subgroup caveats are supported but unnecessary.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly withholds the requested comparative biopsy and patient-outcome effects because the supplied simulation does not provide these outcomes. It does not claim that all performance evidence is absent, or invent a clinical benefit.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: The simulation reports sensitivity, specificity, and examinations triaged but no prospective comparison of biopsy use, treatment, morbidity, or patient outcomes.

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Traditional MRI methodologies require full k-space information, which follows a unique data acquisition sequence to reconstruct the complete image." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "This process presents a time-consuming obstacle for medical imaging techniques." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Our study proposes a novel image reconstruction method to enhance the efficiency of data acquisition while maintaining high accuracy in activation detection." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "The through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques are combined to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme are used to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage." [PMID:41951145]. By applying this approach to both simulated and experimental fMRI data, the study reported reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI). Compared with conventional reconstruction strategies, the proposed method demonstrated potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions, while also providing voxel-wise estimates through a Bayesian framework [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Due to the inherent correlation between Rice's noise and the Magnetic Resonance (MR) signal that occurs during the MR images formation, denoising these images is an important but complex process, as it can prove insufficient and even result in the loss of information details." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "To overcome these two drawbacks, filtering methods based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have been introduced, but the parameters of the filters they propose must be determined with great accuracy." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "In fact, in order to denoise MR images with high Rice's noise levels, we propose adapted filtering anisotropic diffusion PDE filter models by using precise local parameters adjustment." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "Three unbiased anisotropic diffusion filtering models with optimized parameters for Rician noise removing in MR images.." [PMID:41903663]. The various tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to some other published methods, thus demonstrating the high performance of the proposed anisotropic diffusion filters in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

Both methods retain their required steps and distinct validation settings: through/in-plane acceleration, image shifts and 2D Hadamard with simulated and experimental fMRI; Rician noise estimation, adaptive PSO diffusion parameters and synthetic/real MR tests. Bayesian and activation-detection details are supported by the full source, without cross-study superiority. Many background sentences and a title make the answer unnecessarily long.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

For surveillance of local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence, what sensitivities were reported for nasopharyngeal-brush versus plasma EBV DNA testing?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%)." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included." [PMID:41631491].

**Source-first decision**

The quoted source gives recurrence sensitivity 95.7% for nasopharyngeal brush versus 61.4% for plasma, with supported specificity and population context. No reversal of test roles or invented clinical effect.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "A total of 241 patients were included." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "The mean FV was 0.71 ± 0.29 L/min, and the median dialysis vintage was 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.0-11.0 years)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Moreover, no statistically significant interaction was observed (mean difference = 0.13; 95% CI: -3.14 to 3.40; p = 0.94)." [PMID:41644509]. Because the study was designed as a multicenter cross-sectional study enrolling hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and AV access flow measurement between April 2014 and January 2024, the reported association between higher access flow and greater LVMI describes concurrently measured variables and cannot establish that lowering access flow would improve cardiac outcomes [PMID:41644509].

**Source-first decision**

The association, null dialysis-vintage contrast and intervention-limit conclusion are present. However, the causal explanation adds concurrently measured variables, an acquisition-timing assertion not established by the abstract. Count one unsupported material addition, consistently with prior simultaneous/single-time-point failures; internal self-check missed it.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with AVB." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "After adjusting for all factors considered, maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "A total of 3455 vaginal births were included: 3090 spontaneous vaginal births and 365 AVB." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "A secondary analysis compared maternal and neonatal outcomes between perineal and mid/low cavity vacuum applications." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic applications were associated with greater blood loss (p < 0.01), higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01)." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "Mid/low cavity applications showed greater maternal morbidity than perineal applications, underscoring the importance of careful case selection and procedural planning." [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All six adjusted factors, inverse parity association, and all three mid/low versus perineal comparisons match the source, with exact rates and P values. Additional cohort and conclusion quotations are supported but verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, what did online adaptation change in target coverage and organ-at-risk dose, and what treatment-time and toxicity results were reported?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Online adaptation significantly improved target coverage (median V100% change: +0.1%±2.5%) compared to predicted plans (-2.6%±7.3%, p < 0.001), without significant differences in OAR doses." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "A total of 41 patients were enrolled, receiving 232 fractions, of which 178 (76.7%) were treated with ASRT." [PMID:42058324]. Online adaptation produced no significant differences in organ-at-risk doses [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "Median total treatment time was 28 min, with an average 5-minute ASRT workflow." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "No grade ≥ 3 toxicities were reported; grade 2 events occurred in 10.3% of patients." [PMID:42058324].

**Source-first decision**

Retains both target-coverage values and comparison, the nonsignificant organ-at-risk result, total and adaptation times, and grade 2/grade 3-or-higher toxicity findings. The OAR result is repeated; no survival superiority is claimed.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the comparative data needed to establish that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly identifies missing comparative data for local control/survival benefit versus nonadaptive radiotherapy. It does not falsely say that all outcome observations are absent.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
