How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

SCAR-Net is a deep learning model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules, developed using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals. However, the source does not provide specific training process details including optimization algorithm, number of epochs, batch size, loss function, or learning rate used during model training [PMID:42023157]. The model underwent multicenter validation, demonstrating segmentation accuracy with Dice coefficients of 0.918-0.925 compared to traditional methods (0.795-0.811). However, the source does not provide specific validation methodology details including train/validation/test splits, how individual hospitals were utilized in validation (e.g., leave-one-center-out), or the detailed evaluation protocol used for the diagnostic performance assessment [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157]. In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950, with all comparisons showing statistical significance (p < 0.001) [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

Required development cohort, modules and reader AUC/sensitivity/specificity changes are supported. Unrequested training and validation details add clutter and the performance paragraph is repeated; these truthful absences are not counted as unsupported medical claims.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) compared with LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL), demonstrating target-specific tumor localization [PMID:42000453]. The tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 xenograft model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10), confirming selective accumulation in LGR5-positive tumors [PMID:42000453]. Biodistribution studies further confirmed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 can specifically target LGR5-positive tumors, exhibiting superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and effectively localizing LGR5-positive tumors [PMID:42000453]. Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 and [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 in MC38-Nectin4 cells (Nectin4-positive) compared with MC38 cells (Nectin4-negative) [PMID:41916034]. Biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower [PMID:41916034]. The tumor-to-muscle ratio increased progressively over time and reached its maximum at 120 minutes post-injection, indicating specific and time-dependent tracer accumulation in Nectin4-positive tumors [PMID:41916034]. Tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 was consistently higher than that of [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined, demonstrating superior target specificity for the 68Ga-labeled probe [PMID:41916034]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Target-specific tumor-localization evidence for Nectin4 probes in preclinical models.

**Source-first decision**

Both target-specific findings and their separate sources are present. Fail: the appended Nectin4 gap contradicts the reported localization evidence, and higher uptake alone does not establish superior target specificity of the gallium probe over the fluorine probe.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study reported that Ga-LTP-02 showed superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and localized LGR5-positive tumors effectively.

  Evidence `pubmed:42000453:0`:

  > Among them, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors.

- **C2**: The second study found that the tracer accumulated specifically in Nectin4-expressing tumor models, with lower uptake in non-targeted tumors.

  Evidence `pubmed:41916034:0`:

  > In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower.

Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not establish: unnecessary biopsies and patient outcomes.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly refuses the unmeasured biopsy/patient-outcome benefit without denying existing patient data. The source contains a simulated diagnostic workflow, not the requested prospective outcome comparison.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: The simulation reports sensitivity, specificity, and examinations triaged but no prospective comparison of biopsy use, treatment, morbidity, or patient outcomes.

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The fMRI acceleration method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions, using multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage. By applying this approach to simulated and experimental fMRI data, the method successfully reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest compared to conventional reconstruction strategies [PMID:41951145]. The anisotropic diffusion filters achieved excellent results on synthetic and real MR images compared to other published methods, demonstrating high performance in noise reduction and preservation of important details, though actual numeric PSNR, SSIM, and BRISQUE values were not reported in the available evidence [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: PSNR, SSIM, and BRISQUE validation metrics for MR anisotropic-diffusion filters. The retrieved evidence does not establish: fMRI acceleration method details and validation results (acceleration factor, SNR improvement). The retrieved evidence does not establish: Actual quantitative PSNR/SSIM/BRISQUE numeric values.

**Source-first decision**

Both methods and qualitative validation results are present, but the fMRI missing-evidence sentence denies the method and validation just reported. Cross-study planning introduced duplicate gaps and unasked numerical metrics, causing two unnecessary rewrites and exceeding the browser deadline.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

  Evidence `pubmed:41951145:0`:

  > The through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques are combined to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions.

  Evidence `pubmed:41951145:0`:

  > By applying our approach to both simulated and experimental fMRI data, we successfully reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI).

- **C2**: The MR filters used adaptively optimized anisotropic-diffusion models and a Rician-noise estimator; tests on synthetic and real MR images reported noise reduction with preservation of important details.

  Evidence `pubmed:41903663:0`:

  > These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE)).

  Evidence `pubmed:41903663:0`:

  > The various tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to some other published methods, thus demonstrating the high performance of the proposed filters in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the multicenter study of 241 hemodialysis patients, higher arteriovenous access flow (measured as brachial artery flow volume) was significantly associated with increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), with a mean difference of 22.83 (95% CI: 0.37 to 45.29) [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The association between higher AV-access flow and increased LVMI reached statistical significance (p = 0.046) [PMID:41644509]. The study design was a multicenter cross-sectional study, which measures exposure and outcome simultaneously and therefore cannot establish that lowering AV-access flow would improve cardiac outcomes; cross-sectional associations cannot determine temporal sequence or causal direction [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024." [PMID:41644509].

**Source-first decision**

The association including its null contrast and the causal limitation are present. Fail under the same conservative reading used in the prior comparison: the answer asserts simultaneous measurement, but the source does not specify that protocol. Extra quotations repeat results and enrollment dates.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:41644509:0`:

  > Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; <i>p</i> = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; <i>p</i> = 0.27).

- **C2**: Its cross-sectional design establishes neither temporal causality nor whether an intervention to reduce flow would lower LV mass or clinical cardiovascular events.

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort of 3455 vaginal births (365 AVB and 3090 spontaneous vaginal births), multivariable logistic regression identified five factors positively associated with assisted vaginal birth and one inversely associated factor: maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated with AVB [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low-pelvic vacuum applications were associated with greater maternal blood loss (p < 0.01), a higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs  88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use during delivery (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01) [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All adjusted factors, inverse parity association, cohort groups and pelvic/perineal contrasts match the source. No contradictory gap or invented subgroup requirement.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Older maternal age, mode of conception, epidural analgesia, later gestational age, and male newborn sex were positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, whereas parity was inversely associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:42036403:0`:

  > After adjusting for all factors considered, maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated.

- **C2**: Compared with perineal applications, mid/low-pelvic applications had greater blood loss, a higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%), and more ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%).

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not establish: comparative local control or survival data versus nonadaptive radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly refuses a comparative local-control/survival benefit: the source reports one cohort but no nonadaptive comparator. It does not deny observed survival data.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
