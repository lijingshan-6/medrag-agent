## VMG-001

In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, what cardiac MRI findings in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. The researchers conducted a cross-sectional pilot study of matched veterans with and without HIV to explore the relationship between systemic inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, and subclinical cardiac disease in HIV [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Actual increased extracellular volume and lower right-heart MRI findings are complete, with 21 HIV veterans versus 20 controls and cautious interpretation. Higher GDF-15, demographics and the cross-sectional pilot/regression design match the source; association is not made causal.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Compared with controls, veterans with HIV had increased myocardial extracellular volume and lower right-heart function on MRI; the authors said these findings suggested increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

## VMG-002

In the single-arm DYNAMITE study, what structural changes were measured at 9 months and what major adverse cardiac events were observed by 24 months after DynamX implantation?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "The primary co-endpoints were the difference in mean device area and mean in-device lumen area from postprocedure to 9 months as measured by optical coherence tomography." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 9-month follow-up, mean device area increased to 8.53 ± 1.71 mm2 (absolute difference: 0.37 ± 0.99 mm²; relative difference: 5.52 ± 14.8%, p = 0.010), and mean in-device lumen area decreased to 7.57 ± 1.86 mm2 (absolute difference: -0.70 ± 1.09 mm²; relative difference: -7.98 ± 14.9%, p <0.001)." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "A total of 55 patients (55 lesions) were enrolled." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "At 24-month follow-up, 4 patients (7.4%) experienced major adverse cardiac events, including one target vessel myocardial infarction and 4 target lesion revascularization events." [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "DYNAMITE (DYNAMX stent ImplanTation for the trEatment of complex coronary lesions) is an observational, prospective, single-arm, single-center cohort study that enrolled patients with de novo complex coronary lesions undergoing PCI with DynamX between September 2021 and August 2023." [PMID:41765253].

**Source-first decision**

Now reports actual 9-month device/lumen area changes, absolute and relative differences, uncertainty and p values rather than only naming the endpoints. Correct 24-month four-patient MACE count/rate with one MI and four revascularization events. Added 55-patient enrollment and prospective observational single-arm design are source statements; no superiority claim.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: From postprocedure to 9 months, mean device area increased by 0.37 mm² (P=0.010), while mean in-device lumen area decreased by 0.70 mm² (P<0.001).

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. This study highlights the need for larger longitudinal studies to better understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Contains actual higher GDF-15/increased ECV/lower MRI right-heart findings, 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, cautious association and the unresolved longitudinal trajectory. Extra population demographics and regression detail are exact source text. Independently generated text and retrieved source IDs exactly match the reviewed focus_a answer; that semantic decision is reused, not its answer.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, we developed a model incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules." [PMID:42023157]. The study reports: "In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001)." [PMID:42023157]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Uncertainty or confidence intervals associated with the performance change.

**Source-first decision**

Both requested claims are fully answered: development counts/modules and assisted-radiologist validation comparisons with p values, without a false validation denominator. The final answer additionally notes absent uncertainty/confidence intervals, which the supplied abstract indeed does not report. This unrequested gap and a false partial/self-check failure remain a presentation/control defect, not a missing required fact or an invented result. Two unnecessary regenerations are retained.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: SCAR-Net was developed from 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients at four hospitals and used scar-recurrence feature-enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention modules.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) than in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Consistently, the tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 xenograft model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10)." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Moreover, biodistribution studies further confirmed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 can specifically target LGR5-positive tumors." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "Among them, [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors." [PMID:42000453]. The study reports: "In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower." [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

Both required target-specific preclinical findings are present with the correct studies. Additional LGR5 uptake and tumor-to-muscle numbers retain the positive/negative models and match the source; no patient-accuracy or head-to-head claim. Independently generated text and retrieved source IDs exactly match the reviewed focus_a answer; that semantic decision is reused, not its answer.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Our study proposes a novel image reconstruction method to enhance the efficiency of data acquisition while maintaining high accuracy in activation detection." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "The through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques are combined to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions." [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "Multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme are used to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage." [PMID:41951145]. The validation result reported for the fMRI acceleration method is that by applying the approach to both simulated and experimental fMRI data, it successfully reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI), and compared with conventional reconstruction strategies, the proposed method demonstrates potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions while providing voxel-wise estimates through a Bayesian framework [PMID:41951145]. The study reports: "In fact, in order to denoise MR images with high Rice's noise levels, we propose adapted filtering anisotropic diffusion PDE filter models by using precise local parameters adjustment." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "These filtering models incorporate a robust Rician noise estimator and an unbiased variant of filters based on anisotropic diffusion, whose parameters are all calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the introduction of the PSO algorithm and the use of reference-based and no-reference quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE))." [PMID:41903663]. The study reports: "Three unbiased anisotropic diffusion filtering models with optimized parameters for Rician noise removing in MR images.." [PMID:41903663]. The validation result reported for the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters is that the various tests performed on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to some other published methods, thus demonstrating the high performance of the proposed filters in terms of noise reduction and preservation of important details [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

Both actual methods and validation results are covered: through/in-plane fMRI acceleration, image shifts and Hadamard encoding with simulated/experimental scan-time and SNR/CNR findings; adaptive anisotropic diffusion, Rician estimation and PSO with synthetic/real-image noise reduction and detail preservation. The extra qualified activation-detection comparison and Bayesian voxel-wise estimates occur in the fMRI abstract verbatim in substance. No cross-study superiority. One structured-output retry is retained in the log.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

For surveillance of local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence, what sensitivities were reported for nasopharyngeal-brush versus plasma EBV DNA testing?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%)." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a major challenge due to the high incidence of recurrence, often leading to therapeutic failure." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Early detection of recurrence is critical, yet effective surveillance methods are limited." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Head and neck MRI, sinus endoscopy examination, and biopsy of suspicious lesions were used as the gold standard to confirm recurrence." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Patients without recurrence after more than 1 year of follow-up served as controls." [PMID:41631491].

**Source-first decision**

Correct brush-versus-plasma sensitivity comparison. Additional specificity, 187-patient population, reference-standard methods and control follow-up are direct source statements. No invented recurrence benefit or denominator. Independently generated text and retrieved source IDs exactly match the reviewed focus_a answer; that semantic decision is reused, not its answer.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "A total of 241 patients were included." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "The mean FV was 0.71 ± 0.29 L/min, and the median dialysis vintage was 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.0-11.0 years)." [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27)." [PMID:41644509]. The study was a cross-sectional design, which means it can identify associations between AV access flow and LVMI but cannot establish causality or prove that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes [PMID:41644509]. The study reports: "In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow, between April 2014 and January 2024." [PMID:41644509].

**Source-first decision**

Both the flow-LVMI association and the nonsignificant dialysis-vintage contrast are explicitly present with estimates, confidence intervals and p values; the 241-patient count and extra flow/vintage summaries match the source. The answer explains that cross-sectional associations cannot prove causal benefit from lowering flow. The self-check falsely says the fully quoted null contrast is absent, leaving a partial label and two unnecessary regenerations; that defect is preserved separately from content scoring.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:41644509:0`:

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "After adjusting for all factors considered, maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with AVB, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "A total of 3455 vaginal births were included: 3090 spontaneous vaginal births and 365 AVB." [PMID:42036403]. The study reports: "Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic applications were associated with greater blood loss (p < 0.01), higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01)." [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All independent predictors and directions retain their odds ratios and confidence intervals. Population counts and the mid/low-pelvic versus perineal blood-loss, episiotomy and ultrasound comparisons match the source, including p values. No causal treatment benefit inferred.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

## VMG-039

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, what did online adaptation change in target coverage and organ-at-risk dose, and what treatment-time and toxicity results were reported?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Dose differences between predicted, adapted, and original plans were analyzed for target coverage and OARs." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "Online adaptation significantly improved target coverage (median V100% change: +0.1%±2.5%) compared to predicted plans (-2.6%±7.3%, p < 0.001), without significant differences in OAR doses." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "A total of 41 patients were enrolled, receiving 232 fractions, of which 178 (76.7%) were treated with ASRT." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "ASRT involves a rapid online workflow where only body contour and target are recontoured, minimizing changes to organs at risk (OARs)." [PMID:42058324]. To address this limitation, the authors introduce Adaptive Skin Radiotherapy (ASRT), a time-efficient MRIgART workflow designed to maintain accuracy while enhancing feasibility [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "However, prolonged treatment times remain the main obstacle to clinical implementation." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "To address this limitation, we introduce Adaptive Skin Radiotherapy (ASRT), a time-efficient MRIgART workflow designed to maintain accuracy while enhancing feasibility." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "Treatment duration and toxicity were recorded." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "Median total treatment time was 28 min, with an average 5-minute ASRT workflow." [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "No grade ≥ 3 toxicities were reported; grade 2 events occurred in 10.3% of patients." [PMID:42058324].

**Source-first decision**

Complete target-coverage comparator and uncertainty, lack of significant OAR difference, treatment times, grade-3-or-higher absence and grade-2 rate. Source counts 41 patients/232 fractions/178 ASRT fractions and added workflow/background details are preserved without a comparative survival claim. The answer is unnecessarily repetitive, a readability limitation.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Online adaptation improved median V100% target coverage relative to predicted plans (+0.1%±2.5% vs -2.6%±7.3%; P<0.001) without a significant OAR-dose difference.

  Evidence `pubmed:42058324:0`:

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not provide the required comparative data for: Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly refuses comparative local-control/survival benefit because the supplied study lacks the requested nonadaptive comparator. Does not falsely claim that local control or survival were never measured.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
