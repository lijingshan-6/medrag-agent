## VMG-003

In the Behçet's disease echocardiography study, which GLS, RV free-wall strain, and coronary-sinus-flow findings differed from controls, and what performance did the combined GLS-CSF model achieve?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Compared to the control group, GLS (absolute; 18.51 ± 2.02 vs. 19.53 ± 1.71, p = 0.018), right ventricular free wall strain (RVFWS; absolute) (25.35 ± 3.32 vs. 26.87 ± 3.01, p = 0.047), and CSF index (2.62 ± 0.99 vs. 3.58 ± 1.17 mL/min/g, p < 0.001) were found to be significantly lower in the BD group." [PMID:42054004]. The study reports: "This cross-sectional study included 48 BD patients and 35 healthy controls." [PMID:42054004]. The study reports: "Furthermore, the combined model using GLS and the CSF index exhibited a higher diagnostic performance in distinguishing BD patients compared to their individual use (AUC: 0.759, 80.9% sensitivity, 65.7% specificity)." [PMID:42054004].

**Source-first decision**

All three absolute strain/flow reductions and their control comparisons match the source; the combined GLS-CSF AUC, sensitivity and specificity and comparison with individual measures are retained. Cross-sectional 48/35 population context is correct.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Absolute GLS, absolute RV free-wall strain, and the CSF index were all significantly lower in the Behçet's disease group than in controls.

  Evidence `pubmed:42054004:0`:

  > Compared to the control group, GLS (absolute; 18.51 ± 2.02 vs. 19.53 ± 1.71, p = 0.018), right ventricular free wall strain (RVFWS; absolute) (25.35 ± 3.32 vs. 26.87 ± 3.01, p = 0.047), and CSF index (2.62 ± 0.99 vs. 3.58 ± 1.17 mL/min/g, p < 0.001) were found to be significantly lower in the BD group.

- **C2**: The combined GLS-CSF model had AUC 0.759, sensitivity 80.9%, and specificity 65.7%, outperforming either measure used alone.

  Evidence `pubmed:42054004:0`:

  > Furthermore, the combined model using GLS and the CSF index exhibited a higher diagnostic performance in distinguishing BD patients compared to their individual use (AUC: 0.759, 80.9% sensitivity, 65.7% specificity).

## VMG-004

Across the chronic-heart-failure and post-STEMI studies, how was reduced atrial reservoir strain associated with later adverse or heart-failure-related events?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "HF-related events were defined as unplanned hospitalization for HF and heart transplantation." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "In the adjusted analysis, diabetes, Killip class ≥ 2, microvascular obstruction, intramyocardial hemorrhage, ventricular aneurysm, infarct size, LA reservoir (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-.96]; P < 0.001), and conduit strain (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.89-.99]; P = 0.02) were associated with HF-related events." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "The HF risk remained low in patients with relatively preserved LA reservoir function (≥23%), regardless of ejection fraction performance at discharge." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "Among populations with normal LVEF, and reduced LVEF, patients with LA reservoir strain <23% had a 2- to 5-fold increased risk of experiencing HF-related events." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "Reduced LA reservoir strain was independently associated with HF-related events in patients with STEMI, which can improve risk stratification in different LVEF levels and potentially guide decision-making for clinical therapy." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "A total of 1531 patients with STEMI who underwent cardiac MRI were enrolled in this retrospective study." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "Over a median follow-up of 50.9 months, 262 patients reached the endpoints, in which 104 patients developed HF-related events." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "Patients were stratified into four groups according to high or low LASr and RASr based on median values." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death or HF hospitalization." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "Event-free survival differed significantly among the four groups (log-rank test, P < 0.01)." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "Patients with concomitantly low LASr and low RASr had the highest risk of cardiac death or HF hospitalization." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "After adjustment for age, sex, LVEF, left atrial volume index and tricuspid regurgitation velocity, combined low LASr and low RASr remained independently associated with adverse outcomes (hazard ratio 2.43, 95% confidence interval 1.64-3.61; P < 0.01)." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "Combined assessment of LASr and RASr identified a distinct high-risk phenotype in patients with chronic HF and reduced LVEF." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "We retrospectively analyzed 1147 patients with chronic HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% who underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography between January 2018 and May 2023." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "During a median follow-up of 34 months, 221 composite events occurred." [PMID:41932653].

**Source-first decision**

The separate sources preserve the adjusted combined bi-atrial strain association in chronic HF and the below-23-percent 2-to-5-fold post-STEMI risk across LVEF strata. Population, endpoint and follow-up quotations match their own sources. No head-to-head trial is implied, but near-abstract-length extraction is unnecessarily verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study found that combined low left and right atrial reservoir strain was independently associated with adverse outcomes after adjusting for several factors.

  Evidence `pubmed:41932653:0`:

  > After adjustment for age, sex, LVEF, left atrial volume index and tricuspid regurgitation velocity, combined low LASr and low RASr remained independently associated with adverse outcomes (hazard ratio 2.43, 95% confidence interval 1.64-3.61; P < 0.01).

- **C2**: The second study reported that patients with left atrial reservoir strain below 23% had a significantly increased risk of heart failure-related events, regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction status.

  Evidence `pubmed:41894993:0`:

  > Among populations with normal LVEF, and reduced LVEF, patients with LA reservoir strain <23% had a 2- to 5-fold increased risk of experiencing HF-related events.

## VMG-005

What did the pregnancy LVOTO cohort show about transient gradients and later intervention, and what does its observational design prevent concluding about treatment effects?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Gestational increases in LVOT gradients were transient, regressing to baseline levels postpartum for most." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "Pregnancy causes an increase in LVOT gradients but no significant disease progression warranting either antenatal or postpartum intervention, except in patients who had severe LVOTO preconception." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "A total of 78 women with LVOTO (109 pregnancies) were included." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "The primary endpoint was the need for postpartum intervention, while the secondary endpoints were a composite of adverse clinical outcomes and postpartum intervention." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "Postpartum intervention was required in 11% of pregnancies within a median of 6.3 (4.4-9.2) years." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "Predictors of the primary endpoint were baseline LVOTO severity (HR = 29.6, p < 0.01), antenatal LVOTO severity (HR = 21.1, p < 0.01), and postpartum LVOTO severity (HR = 18.3, p < 0.01)." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "While patients with inherently severe LVOTO at baseline (n = 8, 10%) had a significantly increased risk of postpartum intervention, those with transiently severe LVOTO during pregnancy did not." [PMID:41698552]. PMID:41698552 was a retrospective, observational study conducted between 2009 and 2023 in two tertiary centres; because this design is observational rather than randomised, it cannot establish that any treatment or intervention caused the observed clinical outcomes, and its reported associations between LVOTO severity and postpartum intervention cannot be interpreted as treatment effects [PMID:41698552].

**Source-first decision**

Retains transient regression for most, 11-percent postpartum intervention at median 6.3 years, and baseline-versus-transient severity contrast. The final source-derived explanation correctly withholds causal treatment effects from a retrospective observational design, without advising that treatment should never be given. Additional hazard ratios and endpoints are supported but verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: For most pregnancies, gestational LVOT-gradient increases regressed to baseline; 11% required postpartum intervention over a median 6.3 years, with risk concentrated in severe preconception LVOTO rather than transient gestational severity.

  Evidence `pubmed:41698552:0`:

  > Gestational increases in LVOT gradients were transient, regressing to baseline levels postpartum for most. Postpartum intervention was required in 11% of pregnancies within a median of 6.3 (4.4-9.2) years.

  Evidence `pubmed:41698552:0`:

  > While patients with inherently severe LVOTO at baseline (n = 8, 10%) had a significantly increased risk of postpartum intervention, those with transiently severe LVOTO during pregnancy did not.

- **C2**: Because this was a retrospective observational cohort, it cannot show that treating or not treating a gestational gradient changes postpartum outcomes.

  Evidence `pubmed:41698552:0`:

  > A retrospective, observational study was conducted between 2009 and 2023 in two tertiary centres.

## VMG-007

Do the supplied atrial-strain studies show that using atrial-strain-guided management improves heart-failure outcomes compared with standard management?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "We retrospectively analyzed 1147 patients with chronic HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% who underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography between January 2018 and May 2023." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "LASr and right atrial reservoir strain (RASr) were assessed using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death or HF hospitalization." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "Patients were stratified into four groups according to high or low LASr and RASr based on median values." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "Patients with concomitantly low LASr and low RASr had the highest risk of cardiac death or HF hospitalization." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "After adjustment for age, sex, LVEF, left atrial volume index and tricuspid regurgitation velocity, combined low LASr and low RASr remained independently associated with adverse outcomes (hazard ratio 2.43, 95% confidence interval 1.64-3.61; P < 0.01)." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "Combined assessment of LASr and RASr identified a distinct high-risk phenotype in patients with chronic HF and reduced LVEF." [PMID:41932653]. The study reports: "Bi-atrial reservoir strain provides clinically relevant prognostic information beyond conventional echocardiographic measures and may improve risk stratification." [PMID:41932653]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: improvement in heart-failure outcomes with atrial-strain-guided management versus standard management.

**Source-first decision**

The final gap correctly withholds outcome improvement from atrial-strain-guided versus standard management; prognostic associations are not converted into treatment benefit. Thus the answer abstains on the requested comparison. Adjacent prognostic quotations are lengthy, and partial coverage differs from the frozen insufficient classification for this wholly unanswerable intervention question.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: No study in the supplied passages compares atrial-strain-guided management with standard management or estimates its effect on clinical outcomes.

## VMG-008

In the thermal-ablation HCC cohort, how did model-predicted MVI risk stratify recurrence-free survival, and which variables remained independently associated with RFS?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was then compared between model-stratified risk groups in the TA cohort." [PMID:42047408]. The study reports: "In the TA cohort, patients with model-predicted high-risk MVI had significantly lower 1-, 2- and 3-year RFS rates (75.5%, 54.9%, 39.4%) compared to those with low-risk (83.8%, 80.0%, 78.0%) (p < 0.001)." [PMID:42047408]. The study reports: "We enrolled 688 patients with solitary HCC ≤ 5 cm undergoing CEUS before surgical resection (SR) or TA." [PMID:42047408]. The study reports: "Cox regression analysis identified risk factors for RFS." [PMID:42047408]. The study reports: "High MVI risk predicted by the model (HR = 2.90; 95% CI: 1.69-4.96) and AFP-L3% (HR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.06-1.69) were independently associated with RFS in TA patients." [PMID:42047408].

**Source-first decision**

The high/low MVI-risk RFS rates and comparison are preserved, as are independent MVI-risk and AFP-L3 associations in TA patients. The 688-person enrolment is explicitly across surgical resection or TA rather than reassigned to TA alone. Extra cohort and analytic detail is supported.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The model-predicted high-risk microvascular invasion was associated with significantly lower recurrence-free survival rates compared to low-risk patients.

  Evidence `pubmed:42047408:0`:

  > In the TA cohort, patients with model-predicted high-risk MVI had significantly lower 1-, 2- and 3-year RFS rates (75.5%, 54.9%, 39.4%) compared to those with low-risk (83.8%, 80.0%, 78.0%) (p < 0.001).

- **C2**: Both model-predicted high-risk microvascular invasion and AFP-L3% were independently associated with worse recurrence-free survival in patients treated with thermal ablation.

  Evidence `pubmed:42047408:0`:

  > High MVI risk predicted by the model (HR = 2.90; 95% CI: 1.69-4.96) and AFP-L3% (HR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.06-1.69) were independently associated with RFS in TA patients.

## VMG-015

In the multicenter retrospective sTBI study, how did risk-stratified resource allocation change ICU bed occupancy, and what happened to overall prognosis?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "The resource allocation strategy guided by risk stratification significantly reduced ICU bed occupancy rate from 89.2% to 75.6% and improved the utilization efficiency of specialized nursing resources, while the overall prognosis of patients was not negatively affected." [PMID:42065801]. The study reports: "A total of 1000 sTBI patients from multiple medical centers were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study." [PMID:42065801]. The study reports: "Clinical data including vital signs, CT/MRI imaging features, and detailed neurosurgical nursing records were collected." [PMID:42065801].

**Source-first decision**

The answer retains ICU occupancy 89.2 to 75.6 percent, nursing-resource use and the absence of a negative overall-prognosis effect. The retrospective cohort context is correct; no prospective causal efficacy is invented.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Risk-stratified allocation reduced ICU bed occupancy from 89.2% to 75.6% and improved specialized nursing-resource use, while overall prognosis was not negatively affected.

## VMG-016

In adenomyosis with dysmenorrhea, which regional-homogeneity changes distinguished patients from controls, and which pain or emotional measures correlated with the altered regions?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Compared with HCs, AMD patients showed significantly increased sReHo and dReHo in the right fusiform gyrus (FFG; d = 0.84, p < 0.001) and decreased values in the bilateral supramarginal gyri (SMG; d = -0.73, p < 0.001)." [PMID:41614571]. The study reports: "Additional regiongs exhibiting abnormal dReHo were included the bilateral angular gyri, right hippocampus, right cerebellum (lobule 4_5) , left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and multiple subdivisions of the inferior frontal gyrus." [PMID:41614571]. The study reports: "Fifty-two patients with AMD and 52 age- and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-MRI). sReHo and dReHo maps were generated and compared using two-sample t-tests (voxel-level p < 0.01; cluster-level, Gaussian random field corrected p < 0.05), with age, education and head motion as covariates." [PMID:41614571]. The study reports: "Importantly, ReHo in the right FFG positively correlated with pain severity (visual analogue scale (VAS): r = 0.539-0.797, p < 0.001) and anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA): r = 0.442, p = 0.001)." [PMID:41614571]. The study reports: "Abnormalities in the right hippocampus and cerebellum were also significantly associated with anxiety and depression scores (r = 0.555-0.861, all p < 0.001)." [PMID:41614571]. The study reports: "Partial correlation analyses assessed relationships between regional homogeneity (ReHo) alterations and clinical measures, controlling for medication use, menstrual phase and psychiatric history." [PMID:41614571].

**Source-first decision**

Correctly separates increased right-fusiform from decreased bilateral-supramarginal ReHo and retains pain/anxiety versus hippocampal/cerebellar emotional associations. Values, laterality and correlation rather than causation are preserved. Methods and additional brain regions are supported quotations but verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Among adults with epilepsy in Southern Kazakhstan, which seizure-history and MRI features were associated with drug-resistant rather than drug-sensitive epilepsy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "The development of DRE became more likely when patients experienced their first seizure at a young age and when they had multiple seizures throughout the day (p < 0.01)." [PMID:42057682]. The study reports: "The study revealed that early seizure onset, prolonged duration, severe seizures, brain imaging abnormalities, and lower cognitive performance are related to DRE." [PMID:42057682]. The study reports: "The study identified several key correlates of drug-resistant epilepsy, including early age at onset, longer disease duration, frequent and severe seizures, serial seizures, and the need for multiple ASMs." [PMC:doc54].

**Source-first decision**

Early onset, frequent seizures and the MRI-abnormality association with DRE versus DSE are retained without claiming proven causes. Bound full-text/abstract quotations repeat the same 300-person population and criteria, making the response unnecessarily duplicative.

In the thyroid-ultrasound AI meta-analysis, did cytology versus histology as the reference standard significantly explain diagnostic-accuracy differences in mixed-effects meta-regression?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Although subgroup analysis suggested higher accuracy when cytology was used as the reference standard compared to histology, the mixed-effects meta-regression did not confirm a statistically significant association (p = 0.238 for sensitivity; p = 0.188 for specificity)."

[PMID:41477624].

**Source-first decision**

Preserves the distinction between a suggestive subgroup result and the nonsignificant mixed-effects meta-regression, including both P values. It does not promote cytology to a proven superior reference standard. Additional meta-analysis sample context is supported.

After STEMI, how was left-atrial reservoir strain below 23% associated with heart-failure events across LVEF strata, and what risk-stratification conclusion did the study draw?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Among populations with normal LVEF, and reduced LVEF, patients with LA reservoir strain <23% had a 2- to 5-fold increased risk of experiencing HF-related events." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "The HF risk remained low in patients with relatively preserved LA reservoir function (≥23%), regardless of ejection fraction performance at discharge." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "A total of 1531 patients with STEMI who underwent cardiac MRI were enrolled in this retrospective study." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "Over a median follow-up of 50.9 months, 262 patients reached the endpoints, in which 104 patients developed HF-related events." [PMID:41894993]. The study reports: "The endpoint is a composite of all-cause death, HF-related events, reinfarction, and unplanned revascularization." [PMID:41894993]. The study concluded that reduced LA reservoir strain was independently associated with HF-related events in patients with STEMI, which can improve risk stratification in different LVEF levels and potentially guide decision-making for clinical therapy [PMID:41894993].

**Source-first decision**

Retains the below-23-percent threshold, 2-to-5-fold HF-event association across normal/reduced LVEF, and the authors risk-stratification conclusion. It does not turn potential clinical use into demonstrated management benefit. Additional endpoint and population details are supported.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

How did cerebellar glutamate-sensitive MRI measurements and cerebellar volume differ across resting-tremor PD, akinetic-rigid PD, and healthy controls?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Results demonstrated significantly elevated MTRasym values in the dentate nucleus and cerebellar hemisphere of PDRT patients (*p*<0.05), indicative of increased glutamate concentrations." [PMID:41687710]. The study reports: "We enrolled 36 resting-tremor predominant PD (PDRT), 33 akinetic-rigid predominant PD (PDAR), and 40 healthy controls (HCs)." [PMID:41687710]. The study reports: "GluCEST data were quantified via magnetization-transfer-ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) analysis, with four regions of interest (ROIs) manually delineated." [PMID:41687710]. Cerebellar volumetry, derived using the SUIT atlas, showed that PDRT patients exhibited reduced cerebellar volumes compared to HCs, whereas PDAR patients showed no significant volumetric differences [PMID:41687710]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: PDAR GluCEST MTRasym values and direct PDRT-vs-PDAR and PDAR-vs-HC glutamate comparisons.

**Source-first decision**

Both gold claims are present: elevated PDRT MTRasym and reduced PDRT versus unchanged PDAR volume. The SUIT method is reported in the source. The extra gap about PDAR glutamate/direct pairwise comparisons is genuinely absent from the abstract; count a conservative coverage disagreement against the frozen complete label, not an unsupported medical claim. This exposes a scope ambiguity in the question versus its narrower gold claims and must be discussed without changing the frozen rubric.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Resting-tremor-predominant PD showed elevated MTRasym in the dentate nucleus and cerebellar hemisphere, consistent with increased glutamate concentrations.

  Evidence `pubmed:41687710:0`:

  > Results demonstrated significantly elevated MTR<sub>asym</sub> values in the dentate nucleus and cerebellar hemisphere of PDRT patients (*p*<0.05), indicative of increased glutamate concentrations.

What did the two retrospective studies report about microwave ablation for benign thyroid nodules, and how do their populations and follow-up constrain comparison of outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "The median initial volume was 14.59 mL, final VRR reached 80.73% (mean follow-up 28.32 ± 7.91 months), with 91.87% achieving >50% VRR at 12th month." [PMID:42003534]. The study reports: "Comparing to pre-ablation, symptom scores significantly decreased from 3.20 ± 2.75 to 0.76 ± 1.15 (p < 0.001), and cosmetic scores from 3.34 ± 0.85 to 1.97 ± 0.84 (p < 0.001) at 12th month post-ablation." [PMID:42003534]. The study reports: "The major complication rate was 4.88%, with no cases of permanent sequelae." [PMID:42003534]. The study reports: "No significant differences were observed in outcomes between high-risk surgical and low-risk surgical groups (VRR: 68.72% vs 69.96%, p = 0.57, complications: 26.67% vs 18.52%, p = 0.49)." [PMID:42003534]. The study reports: "Baseline nodule volume showed a significant negative correlation with VRR (β = -0.82, p < 0.001)." [PMID:42003534]. The study reports: "This retrospective study included 123 patients with 123 solid BTNs greater than 10 mL in size who underwent ultrasound-guided MWA between March 2019 and May 2024." [PMID:42003534]. The study reports: "Nodule volumes significantly decreased at the third and sixth month follow-ups, with similar volume reduction ratios between cMWA and uMWA (60.30 ± 8 vs 57.29 ± 8.2 at 3 mo and 78.03 ± 6 vs 77.55 ± 10 at 6 mo)." [PMID:41860416]. The study reports: "Energy power and ablation duration differed significantly between groups (uMWA: 15 watts, 26.92 ± 4.9 min vs cMWA: 30 watts, 14.77 ± 4.79 min)." [PMID:41860416]. The study reports: "One major and 2 minor complications (nodule rupture and superficial hematoma) occurred only in the cMWA group." [PMID:41860416]. The study reports: "Cosmetic concerns and pressure symptoms improved in both groups during follow-up. uMWA provided similar volume reduction to cooled systems and demonstrated a favorable safety profile." [PMID:41860416]. The study reports: "However, observed differences in complications require cautious interpretation because of the limited sample size and the inherent difference in power settings." [PMID:41860416]. The study reports: "Data from 73 patients who underwent MWA treatment for BTN between September 2019 and May 2022 were retrospectively evaluated." [PMID:41860416]. The study reports: "A total of 24 patients [mean age: 43.87 ± 9.5 years; 15 females (62.5%)] with solid or predominantly solid nodules, who received a single session of cMWA (n = 12) or uMWA (n = 12), were included." [PMID:41860416]. The study reports: "Conventional ultrasound (US) examinations were performed at 1,3,6,12 months after ablation and annually thereafter." [PMID:42003534].

**Source-first decision**

The two studies remain separate: 123 large solid nodules with long follow-up and final VRR/complication result, versus the selected 24-person cooled/uncooled comparison at 3/6 months. The source caution about sample size and power settings is retained, as are the 73 screened versus 24 included roles. Comparison constraints are mostly conveyed by juxtaposition; extensive extra outcomes make the answer verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: In 123 solid nodules larger than 10 mL, final median volume reduction was 80.73% after mean follow-up of 28.32 months, and no permanent sequelae were reported despite a 4.88% major-complication rate.

How well did ultrasound AI models diagnose malignant thyroid nodules in the external-dataset meta-analysis, and which evidence needed for broad clinical adoption remains missing?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Overall, pooled sensitivity was 87 % (95 % CI: 84-89 %) and specificity 83 % (95 % CI: 79-86 %)." [PMID:41477624]. The study reports: "The summary operating point indicated a sensitivity of 88 % and specificity of 83 %, with an AUC of 91.9 % (95 % CI: 90.0-93.2 %)." [PMID:41477624]. The study reports: "AI-based algorithms show excellent diagnostic performance in distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid nodules, with robust validation across external datasets." [PMID:41477624]. The study reports: "Twenty-seven studies comprising 146,332 patients and over 600,000 ultrasound images met inclusion criteria." [PMID:41477624]. The study reports: "Eligible studies included patients with thyroid nodules undergoing ultrasound, where AI-based models were validated against cytological or histological findings." [PMID:41477624]. The study reports: "Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were estimated using a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model." [PMID:41477624]. The source states that the findings support potential integration of AI into clinical thyroid nodule management, but that further multicenter, non-Asian, and histology-based studies are warranted; these are the additional studies needed for broad clinical adoption [PMID:41477624].

**Source-first decision**

The diagnostic metrics, 27-study scope and call for multicenter/non-Asian/histology-based research match the source. However, the answer never states the frozen required gap about actual adoption effects on biopsy, surgery, missed cancer or patient outcomes. General calls for more studies do not satisfy that specific boundary. Strict failure for missing boundary acknowledgement, not an invented efficacy claim; complete coverage is also misleading.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Across 27 studies, pooled sensitivity was 87%, specificity 83%, and the summary AUC 91.9%; the authors still called for more multicenter, non-Asian, histology-based studies.

What safety evidence did the patient-level femoral-vein-ultrasound study and the German AF-ablation trend study provide, and why are their estimates not directly comparable?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Safety outcomes favored the ultrasound group, showing reduced arterial mispuncture (2.7% vs 14.0%), blood vessel spasm (3.3% vs 11.3%), and abnormal catheter path events (2.0% vs 11.3%) (all P <.01)." [PMID:42065181]. The study reports: "Puncture-related complications were significantly decreased, including overall hematoma (10.0% vs 31.3%), persistent oozing (6.7% vs 17.3%), infection (0.7% vs 4.7%), deep vein thrombosis (2.0% vs 7.3%), pseudoaneurysm (0% vs 4.0%), and arteriovenous fistula (0.7% vs 4.7%) (all P <.05)." [PMID:42065181]. The study reports: "Additional interventions - extended compression, hematoma drainage, and anticoagulation adjustment - were markedly less frequent in the ultrasound group (overall 4.7% vs 21.3%, P <.001)." [PMID:42065181]. The study reports: "This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 300 AF patients undergoing RFCA across 3 tertiary hospitals from September 2024 to December 2025 under uninterrupted anticoagulation." [PMID:42065181]. The study reports: "Patients were assigned to a preprocedural ultrasound localization group (n = 150) or a conventional anatomical landmark group (n = 150)." [PMID:42065181]. The study reports: "Utilization of transesophageal echocardiography (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.81-0.83, p < 0.001) and intensive care treatment declined (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.94, p < 0.001) and there was a trend toward a reduced incidence of pericardial tamponade."

The study reports: "Analyzing 29 144 CA cases (89.4% from high-volume centers), a significant increase in case numbers was observed throughout the study period (IRR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07, p < 0.001)." [PMID:42041074]. The two studies' estimates are not directly comparable because they differ in design, unit of analysis, and outcome metrics: the ultrasound study was a multicenter retrospective cohort of 300 AF patients undergoing RFCA at 3 tertiary hospitals, assigned to a preprocedural ultrasound localization group (n = 150) or a conventional anatomical landmark group (n = 150), and reported patient-level complication proportions (for example arterial mispuncture 2.7% vs 14.0% and overall hematoma 10.0% vs 31.3%), whereas the German study was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of administrative data from 87 German hospitals, extracted inpatient CA cases using ICD-10 and OPS codes, analyzed 29 144 CA cases, calculated incidence-rate ratios (IRR) for case numbers with 95% confidence intervals using negative binomial models, and reported an odds ratio for intensive care treatment (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.94, p < 0.001) with pericardial tamponade reported only as a trend rather than a quantified estimate; moreover, because the ultrasound study's group assignment was retrospective and non-randomized, its between-group complication differences cannot establish that adopting ultrasound localization causes improved clinical outcomes [PMID:42065181] [PMID:42041074].

**Source-first decision**

Preserves puncture-complication reductions and the separate German tamponade/TEE trend. The explanation correctly separates the 300-person patient-level comparison from 87-hospital administrative trends. ICD/OPS extraction, negative-binomial IRR analysis and unquantified tamponade trend are present in the full abstract; no causal link between the two studies is invented. Repeated methods and numbers are verbose.

What population-level changes followed the 2020 CMV trial in the French retrospective cohort, and why do those trends not by themselves prove that expanded screening is safe or beneficial?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Compared with the period from 2017 to 2020, in the period from 2021 to 2023 there was a significant increase in both systematic CMV screening (from 22.0% to 40.0%; P = 0.001) and maternal requests for testing (from 0% to 4.2%; P = 0.02)." [PMID:42076947]. The study reports: "Among cases of maternal infection during the periconceptional period or in the first trimester, antiviral therapy (generally valacyclovir) was administered more frequently in the period from 2021 to 2023 (27.7% vs 59.8%; P < 0.0001)." [PMID:42076947]. The study reports: "The overall rate of termination of pregnancy (TOP) for early maternal CMV-PI was 20.7% (40/193 with known pregnancy outcome), with significantly fewer TOPs being performed in the period from 2021 to 2023 (25.9% vs 13.0%; P = 0.03)." [PMID:42076947]. The study reports: "Despite the lack of national guidelines for systematic maternal CMV screening until mid-2025, the uptake of maternal CMV screening and preventive treatment increased significantly in France after publication of the pivotal RCT in 2020, apparently without an associated rise in the rate of TOP." [PMID:42076947]. In this retrospective, multicenter study, maternal, fetal and neonatal data in cases with maternal primary infection during the periconceptional period or first trimester were compared between the periods before and after publication of a pivotal randomized controlled trial (RCT) in September 2020 [PMID:42076947]. Because the reported changes come from a retrospective, multicenter before-after observational comparison of periods rather than a randomized comparison, they cannot by themselves establish that expanded screening is safe or beneficial; an observational association does not establish the effect of intervening on the exposure [PMID:42076947].

**Source-first decision**

Retains both time periods, screening and treatment increases, and TOP decline. The explanation correctly distinguishes the before-after observational cohort from the separately published RCT, and withholds causal safety/benefit conclusions. No screening-prevention claim is invented.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

## VMG-029

In postmenopausal women, which extracellular-vesicle and metabolite patterns accompanied coronary artery calcification, and how did prior preeclampsia relate to later CVD or CKD within the CAC-positive group?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Patients with, versus those without, CAC demonstrated 1) less favorable cardiovascular and metabolic profiles; 2) elevation in six EV populations, including those positive for tissue factor, CD3 (T-cells), SM22α (smooth muscle cells), Pref-1 (adipocytes), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (adipocytes/macrophages), and p16 (senescent cells); 3) significantly higher levels of proline, allothreonine (amino acid metabolism), and ribitol (carbohydrate metabolism), and lower levels of lactic acid (carbohydrate metabolism); and 4) significantly increased risk of developing CVD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (P < 0.05 for all)." [PMID:41973512]. The study reports: "Clinical data were obtained from medical records for postmenopausal women (median age 60 yr) free of cardiovascular events with (n = 29) and without (n = 29) CAC." [PMID:41973512]. The study reports: "EVs per microliter plasma were quantified by digital flow cytometry, and plasma metabolites were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry." [PMID:41973512]. The study reports: "CACs were measured by computer tomography and reported as the Agatston score." [PMID:41973512]. The study reports: "In the CAC-positive group, women with PE versus those with normotensive pregnancy histories demonstrated a four times higher risk of developing cardiovascular events or CKD later in life (P = 0.028)." [PMID:41973512].

**Source-first decision**

All six EV populations and all four metabolite directions match the source, with CAC-positive versus negative context and the PE-associated later CVD/CKD risk within the CAC-positive group. The quoted 29/29 population is correct and no causal claim is added. Assay methods are additional.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

In the single-center CT-versus-TEE pathway study before cardioversion, what was the observed acute-kidney-injury difference, and was it statistically significant?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Acute kidney injury occurred in 8.1% of CT patients compared with 3.9% in the TEE group (absolute risk difference +4.2%, 95% CI: -1.4% to +12.9%; OR 2.18, 95% CI: 0.60-7.45; p = 0.21)." [PMID:42041167]. The study reports: "Among 74 patients undergoing CT-guided cardioversion and 206 undergoing TEE-guided cardioversion, no strokes or TIAs occurred within 48 h in either group (0/74 CT vs. 0/206 TEE, p = 1.0)." [PMID:42041167].

**Source-first decision**

The answer retains 8.1 versus 3.9 percent, +4.2 absolute difference, the interval crossing zero and P=0.21. These numerical uncertainty statements preserve the reported nonsignificance, although a plain-language not statistically significant sentence would answer the question more directly. Treat this as a presentation limitation, not missing statistical evidence. The extra stroke/TIA result is supported but unrequested.

How did a CT-based ccRCC T-stage prediction study differ from the tubulocystic RCC imaging series in clinical aim, sample size, and reported imaging value?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Advances in the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) toward risk-based therapy intensity modulation have necessitated patient-specific assessments of preoperative T-stage." [PMID:41657050]. The study reports: "Important Role of Ultrasound in Assessing Tubulocystic Renal Cell Carcinoma.." [PMID:42044518]. The study reports: "Tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma is a rare renal neoplasm with imaging characteristics that may make it challenging to differentiate from benign cystic lesions." [PMID:42044518].

The study reports: "On CT, masses demonstrated low attenuation (mean 15 HU) with variable enhancement (mean 23 HU)." [PMID:42044518]. The study reports: "US in 5 cases showed 3 uniformly hyperechoic, 1 mixed echogenic, and 1 septated hypoechoic mass, all demonstrating posterior acoustic enhancement." [PMID:42044518].

**Source-first decision**

The two studies retain different clinical aims, 218 versus seven cases, ccRCC predictors and model-versus-radiologist AUC, and the descriptive tubulocystic ultrasound finding. The derivation cohort is quoted with its original role. The extended quotations and paper title are verbose, but no invented cross-study accuracy ranking appears.

In the two preclinical GOx nanoplatforms, how was glucose oxidase combined with the carrier and other mechanisms to intensify tumor treatment?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "To address these issues, we developed a multifunctional nanoplatform by encapsulating GOx within hollow porous superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-GOx NPs) to preserve its catalytic activity and enable high loading capacity." [PMID:41653578]. The study reports: "This system simultaneously enables magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), photothermal therapy, and enzyme-mediated catalytic intervention." [PMID:41653578]. The study reports: "In vitro studies demonstrated strong T2-weighted MRI contrast for precise tumor localization, together with near-infrared laser-triggered hyperthermia that enhance the efficacy of GOx-mediated starvation therapy, elevating oxidative stress and promoting apoptosis in 4T1 cells." [PMID:41653578]. The study reports: "In 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, a single administration of Fe3O4-GOx NPs combined with laser irradiation elicited potent tumor suppression through the synergistic effects of intratumoral ROS generation, glucose depletion, and localized photothermal ablation, outperforming either modality alone." [PMID:41653578]. For the MnOx-GOx-PM@Ma platform, the authors developed a tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive nanoplatform composed of manganese oxide nanoflowers (MnOx NFs) co-loaded with glucose oxidase (GOx) and an activatable melittin pro-peptide (PM), and coated with macrophage membranes (Ma) for targeted delivery [PMID:41812546]. The study reports: "Combined MnOx NFs and GOx trigger O2/H2O2 cyclic generation, thereby amplifying CDT in the acidic and glutathione (GSH)-rich TME." [PMID:41812546]. The study reports: "Meanwhile, the PM is selectively cleaved by lysosomal legumain to activate melittin, which disrupts lysosomal membranes and converts cytoprotective autophagy into a pro-death process." [PMID:41812546]. The study reports: "Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that MnOx-GOx-PM@Ma effectively suppresses tumor growth through synergistic starvation therapy, enhanced CDT, and autophagy inhibition." [PMID:41812546].

**Source-first decision**

Both carriers and amplification mechanisms remain attached to their own preclinical sources: Fe3O4 GOx plus photothermal/starvation effects, and MnOx GOx cyclic oxygen/peroxide CDT plus the PM component. The non-quoted MnOx platform description matches the full abstract. No safety or efficacy in patients is asserted.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: In the first platform, manganese-oxide nanoflowers and GOx triggered cyclic O₂/H₂O₂ generation, amplifying chemodynamic therapy in the acidic, glutathione-rich tumor microenvironment.

What prognostic association did the HCC model show after thermal ablation, and what evidence is missing before using it to choose treatment?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "In the TA cohort, patients with model-predicted high-risk MVI had significantly lower 1-, 2- and 3-year RFS rates (75.5%, 54.9%, 39.4%) compared to those with low-risk (83.8%, 80.0%, 78.0%) (p < 0.001)."

The study reports: "Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was then compared between model-stratified risk groups in the TA cohort." [PMID:42047408]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Prospective validation and clinical utility evidence that using the model to choose treatment improves outcomes.

**Source-first decision**

The answer reports high/low risk-group RFS rates and correctly withholds prospective treatment-selection utility. However, it omits the required adjusted prognostic result: independent MVI-risk association with HR 2.90 and interval, and AFP-L3 with HR 1.34 and interval. The stratified survival comparison is not the specified compound C1, so no complete gold claim is mapped. Strict failure for omitted required result, despite self-check passing.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Model-predicted high MVI risk was independently associated with recurrence-free survival after thermal ablation (HR 2.90, 95% CI 1.69-4.96), as was AFP-L3% (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.69).

For the CT-based NSCLC survival model, how did performance compare with benchmark 3D networks on LUNG1, and what did transfer learning add on the smaller private dataset?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Our approach was compared to benchmark 3D networks and two variants of our methodology: on the LUNG1 it outperformed the competitors achieving a mean C td   -index of 0.584 over tenfold cross-validation." [PMID:41492270]. The study reports: "On the LUNG1 we also demonstrated the adaptability of our method with 5 other 2D backbones replacing the EfficientNetB0, confirming that our mechanism of combining 2D slice representations to construct a 3D volume representation is more effective for OS prediction compared to a traditional 3D approach."

Across the two HFpEF studies, what did resting alveolar-capillary membrane conductance indicate about exercise physiology, and what did systolic aortic-regurgitation vena-contracta width indicate about prognosis?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Compared to controls, HFpEF group exhibited lower DLCO and Dm at rest and a higher number of B-lines at peak of exercise with a significant correlation observed for HFpEF but not for controls (resting DLCO vs peak B-lines in HFpEF: R = - 0,66, P < 0,001; resting Dm vs peak B-lines in HFpEF: R = - 0,72, P <0,001)." [PMID:41933596]. The study reports: "We found also a significant negative correlation between Dm at rest with VE/VCO2 slope (R = - 0,51, P < 0,001), and Dm at rest with E/e' at peak of stress test in HFpEF group (R = - 0,59, P < 0,001), reflecting a ventilatory/perfusion mismatch along with an elevation of left ventricular filling pressures exacerbated by exercise." [PMID:41933596]. The study reports: "In HFpEF altered pulmonary gas exchange capacity at rest, and an excessive lung extravascular water at rest and during effort are combinatory factors affecting exercise performance." [PMID:41933596]. The study reports: "DLCO, Dm and Vcap were measured in 40 stable HFpEF subjects (age = 73 ± 8; BMI = 27,1 ± 4,3 kg/m2) and in healthy controls at rest with parallel assessment of B-lines during combined Stress Echocardiography and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (ESE-CPET)." [PMID:41933596]. The study reports: "B-lines evaluation of both hemithorax was performed at rest and at peak of exercise." [PMID:41933596]. The study reports: "The true cause-effect relationship between these variables needs to be tested by mechanicistic experimental studies." [PMID:41933596].

The study reports: "The vena contracta width of SAR was an independently predictor associated with the composite endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio 1.259 per 1 mm increase, 95% confident interval 1.118-1.417, p < 0.0001), alongside atrial fibrillation and E/e'." [PMID:41864586]. The study reports: "SAR marks a high-risk HFpEF phenotype." [PMID:41864586]. The study reports: "In this retrospective single-center study, 412 participants admitted with HFpEF in the past 10 years were included and echocardiographies during hospitalization were assessed."

The study reports: "Incorporating SAR into routine echocardiographic reporting may improve risk stratification and guide targeted management." [PMID:41864586].

**Source-first decision**

The exercise study retains both Dm correlations and physiological interpretation. The separate prognosis study retains the six-year endpoint, adjusted 1.259-per-mm SAR hazard and accompanying predictors. Population and endpoint counts remain study-specific; extensive extra quotations are redundant but supported.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: In the exercise study, lower resting alveolar-capillary membrane conductance correlated with a higher VE/VCO2 slope and higher peak-stress E/e′, which the authors interpreted as ventilatory-perfusion mismatch with exercise-exacerbated filling pressure.

## VMG-041

Why do the CABG data on TEE plus pulmonary-artery catheter use require comparator-specific interpretation, and what evidence is still needed before choosing a monitoring strategy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Adjusted analyses revealed a higher risk of the primary outcome for TEE + PAC (aRR 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25) and PAC alone (aRR 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09), while TEE alone was not significant (aRR 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.14) versus neither modality." [PMID:42069508]. The study reports: "PAC alone was associated with lower 30-day mortality (aRR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.93) versus neither modality." [PMID:42069508]. The study reports: "When compared to TEE alone, TEE + PAC was associated with a lower risk of 30-day mortality (aRR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.96)." [PMID:42069508]. The study reports: "PAC use was associated with mixed findings depending on the comparator." [PMID:42069508]. The study reports: "Among 70,065 patients undergoing CABG, 45.5% received TEE and 70.7% PAC." [PMID:42069508]. The study reports: "Transesophageal echocardiography and pulmonary artery catheter use and short-term outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery: A multi-center retrospective study.." [PMID:42069508]. The study reports: "This population-based study included adults (≥ 18 years old) undergoing isolated CABG from 2009 to 2019 across 11 Ontario centers using administrative databases." [PMID:42069508]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: Prospective studies identifying subgroups benefiting from specific modalities and evaluating longer-term outcomes.

**Source-first decision**

The answer retains comparator-specific aRR directions, but calls the 1.18 result only primary outcome and never defines it as death or major complications, a material endpoint qualifier needed to distinguish it from mortality alone. It also omits the required design-based explanation that retrospective administrative associations do not establish causal monitoring benefit, so C2 is not fully mapped. The prospective/long-term gap alone does not supply that explanation. Record one missing endpoint qualifier and a coverage disagreement; no causal superiority claim is invented.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: TEE plus PAC was associated with more 30-day mortality or major complications than neither modality (aRR 1.18), yet with lower 30-day mortality than TEE alone (aRR 0.59); PAC findings therefore depended on the comparator and outcome.

  Evidence `pubmed:42069508:0`:

  > Adjusted analyses revealed a higher risk of the primary outcome for TEE + PAC (aRR 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25) and PAC alone (aRR 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09), while TEE alone was not significant (aRR 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.14) versus neither modality.

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "After applying DL-ACE and DL-DN in Groups B and C, arterial attenuation increased by 45.4% and image noise decreased by 34.5%, resulting in significantly higher arterial attenuation, CNR, and subjective image quality compared with Group A (P < 0.001)." [PMID:42062228]. The study reports: "DL-ACE and DL-DN significantly increased arterial attenuation and reduced image noise, resulting in higher CNR and better subjective image quality."

During and after pregnancy in women with LV outflow-tract obstruction, which severity measurements predicted postpartum intervention, and how did inherently severe versus transiently severe obstruction differ?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Predictors of the primary endpoint were baseline LVOTO severity (HR = 29.6, p < 0.01), antenatal LVOTO severity (HR = 21.1, p < 0.01), and postpartum LVOTO severity (HR = 18.3, p < 0.01)." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "The primary endpoint was the need for postpartum intervention, while the secondary endpoints were a composite of adverse clinical outcomes and postpartum intervention." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "A total of 78 women with LVOTO (109 pregnancies) were included." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "While patients with inherently severe LVOTO at baseline (n = 8, 10%) had a significantly increased risk of postpartum intervention, those with transiently severe LVOTO during pregnancy did not." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "Gestational increases in LVOT gradients were transient, regressing to baseline levels postpartum for most." [PMID:41698552]. The study reports: "Pregnancy causes an increase in LVOT gradients but no significant disease progression warranting either antenatal or postpartum intervention, except in patients who had severe LVOTO preconception." [PMID:41698552].

**Source-first decision**

All baseline/antenatal/postpartum hazard ratios and P values map to postpartum intervention. The inherent severe baseline versus transient gestational contrast is preserved, with correct women/pregnancy counts and no invented treatment comparison.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Baseline, antenatal, and postpartum LVOTO severity predicted postpartum intervention, with hazard ratios 29.6, 21.1, and 18.3, respectively (all P<0.01).

What did the small postmenopausal-women study associate with CAC and later CVD or CKD, and which sample and design limits constrain causal or general claims?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Patients with, versus those without, CAC demonstrated 1) less favorable cardiovascular and metabolic profiles; 2) elevation in six EV populations, including those positive for tissue factor, CD3 (T-cells), SM22α (smooth muscle cells), Pref-1 (adipocytes), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (adipocytes/macrophages), and p16 (senescent cells); 3) significantly higher levels of proline, allothreonine (amino acid metabolism), and ribitol (carbohydrate metabolism), and lower levels of lactic acid (carbohydrate metabolism); and 4) significantly increased risk of developing CVD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (P < 0.05 for all)." [PMID:41973512]. The study reports: "In the CAC-positive group, women with PE versus those with normotensive pregnancy histories demonstrated a four times higher risk of developing cardiovascular events or CKD later in life (P = 0.028)." [PMID:41973512]. Clinical data were obtained from medical records for postmenopausal women (median age 60 yr) free of cardiovascular events with (n = 29) and without (n = 29) CAC; EVs per microliter plasma were quantified by digital flow cytometry, plasma metabolites were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and CAC was measured by computer tomography and reported as the Agatston score [PMID:41973512]. Because the study compared only 29 postmenopausal women with CAC against 29 without CAC, its small sample of postmenopausal women free of cardiovascular events limits how far the reported associations can be generalized to other populations [PMID:41973512]. The reported design compares women grouped by the presence or absence of prevalent CAC, so the associated EV populations, metabolites, and pregnancy history cannot by themselves establish that these factors cause CAC or that modifying them changes later CVD or CKD outcomes [PMID:41973512].

**Source-first decision**

Retains the CAC-associated profiles, EV/metabolite directions and fourfold PE-associated later risk. The source-bound 29/29 postmenopausal sample and observational comparison are used to explain limited generalization and causal interpretation, without claiming that modifying a marker changes outcomes. The detailed assay paragraph is supported but unnecessary.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Women with CAC had less favorable cardiovascular/metabolic profiles and distinct extracellular-vesicle and metabolite levels; within the CAC-positive group, prior preeclampsia was associated with fourfold higher later CVD or CKD risk.

After reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, how did high versus low preoperative fatty infiltration relate to final forward-elevation and external-rotation strength, and to improvement from baseline?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "At the final follow-up, patients in the high FI group demonstrated significantly reduced strength in both forward elevation ( P = 0.049) and ER ( P = 0.007) compared with those in the low FI group." [PMID:41248236]. The study reports: "From January 2016 to June 2022, 139 patients who underwent primary RTSA with single lateralized implant with at least 2 years of follow-up were reviewed." [PMID:41248236]. The study reports: "According to FI of ISP from preoperative MRI, patients were divided into high ISP FI group (n = 88) and low ISP FI group (n = 51)." [PMID:41248236]. The study reports: "However, the mean improvement in muscle strength from preoperative to postoperative evaluation in forward elevation and ER showed no significant difference between two groups ( P = 0.559, 0.675, respectively)." [PMID:41248236].

**Source-first decision**

Keeps the distinction between lower final strength in high FI and no significant difference in improvement from baseline for either motion, with correct P values and 88/51 group context. This avoids turning a final-level difference into a recovery difference.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

For acute hand and wrist trauma, how did adding calcium-suppression images to conventional CT affect reader sensitivity, specificity, and additional fracture detection versus CT alone and X-ray?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "Sensitivity was increased significantly for both readers in CT + CaSupp (94.3 and 97.2%) compared to conventional CT (88.2 and 90.1%, p < .01) and X-ray (72.6 and 75.9%, p < .01)." [PMID:41653331]. The study reports: "Retrospective inclusion of 125 patients who underwent both X-ray and SpCT examinations of the hand and wrist in an acute trauma setting." [PMID:41653331]. The study reports: "Of the 125 patients (mean age, 55 years ± 19.5 [SD]; 67 female), 120 presented with at least one fracture, for a total of 212 fractured bones." [PMID:41653331]. The study reports: "Two independent readers evaluated fracture presence on X-ray, conventional CT, and conventional CT plus CaSupp images (time interval 4 weeks, each)." [PMID:41653331]. The study reports: "Specificity was 99.9 and 100% for CT + CaSupp, 99.8 and 99.9% for conventional CT, and 99.4 and 99.9% for X-ray." [PMID:41653331]. The study reports: "Sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to the consensus reading as the reference standard." [PMID:41653331]. The study reports: "Reader 1 detected 13 additional fractures in CT + CaSupp compared to conventional CT alone, while Reader 2 detected 15 additional fractures." [PMID:41653331]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: additional fractures detected with CT+CaSupp compared with X-ray.

**Source-first decision**

Both readers sensitivity, specificity and additional-fracture counts match the required CT-plus-CaSupp versus CT/X-ray comparisons. The added gap correctly notes that a separate additional-fracture count versus X-ray is absent. Count a conservative disagreement with the frozen complete label; the broad question wording versus narrower gold count comparison is an annotation-scope ambiguity, not an unsupported finding. Extra cohort methods are verbose.

The study reports: "CaSupp images in combination with conventional CT images significantly improved sensitivity for acute trauma fracture detection in the hand and wrist compared to conventional CT images alone and X-ray." [PMID:41653331]. The study reports: "Retrospective inclusion of 125 patients who underwent both X-ray and SpCT examinations of the hand and wrist in an acute trauma setting." [PMID:41653331]. The study reports: "Of the 125 patients (mean age, 55 years ± 19.5 [SD]; 67 female), 120 presented with at least one fracture, for a total of 212 fractured bones." [PMID:41653331]. The study reports: "Images were reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP), and images in Groups B and C were additionally reconstructed using DL-ACE and DL-DN." [PMID:42062228]. The study reports: "After applying DL-ACE and DL-DN in Groups B and C, arterial attenuation increased by 45.4% and image noise decreased by 34.5%, resulting in significantly higher arterial attenuation, CNR, and subjective image quality compared with Group A (P < 0.001)." [PMID:42062228]. The study reports: "DL-ACE and DL-DN significantly increased arterial attenuation and reduced image noise, resulting in higher CNR and better subjective image quality." [PMID:42062228]. The study reports: "In this prospective study, 47 healthy volunteers (male:female, 31:16; mean age ± standard deviation, 57.8 ± 10.9 years) were randomly assigned to one of three CTA protocols: Group A (n = 16; 100 kVp, 40 mL of 350 mgI/mL), Group B (n = 16; 70 kVp, 40 mL of 270 mgI/mL), and Group C (n = 15; 70 kVp, 28 mL of 270 mgI/mL [ultralow iodine]), with an injection rate of 2.5 mL/s for all." [PMID:42062228]. The study reports: "With FBP, arterial attenuation was significantly higher in Groups B (435.8 ± 50.2 Hounsfield units [HU]) and C (391.8 ± 52.1 HU) than in Group A (321.1 ± 47.4 HU) (P < 0.001), while CNR did not differ significantly (Group A, 19.9 ± 4.7; Group B, 20.3 ± 3.8; and Group C, 18.4 ± 4.6) due to higher image noise in Groups B and C." [PMID:42062228]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: improvement in image quality (e.g., subjective image quality, noise, or CNR) with calcium suppression in hand/wrist spectral CT.

**Source-first decision**

Both frozen claims are supplied with correct sources, detection sensitivity and CTA attenuation/noise/CNR/quality findings. The final gap distinguishes diagnostic detection performance from direct image-quality metrics in the CaSupp paper. That limitation is defensible given the question wording, although it disagrees with the frozen complete classification; retain the disagreement and document the gold scope ambiguity. No head-to-head comparison is invented, but the answer is verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Adding calcium-suppression images increased fracture-detection sensitivity for both readers versus conventional CT alone and X-ray.

## VMG-049

What association linked 6MCTB performance with lumbar-multifidus activation in chronic low-back pain, and what treatment-effect evidence is absent?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study reports: "LM activation showed significantly reduced activation (P < 0.05) in patients with positive flexion-specific tests, extension-specific tests, and summation compared to those with negative results." [PMID:41927242]. The study reports: "Based on individual tests, direction-specific classification, and summation from the 6MCTB, poorer test performance was consistently associated with reduced LM activation in patients with CLBP." [PMID:41927242]. The study reports: "These findings suggest that LM dysfunction is more strongly associated with 6MCTB performance than with TrA activation in this testing context." [PMID:41927242]. The study reports: "Forty-two patients with CLBP underwent the 6MCTB, comprising three flexion-specific tests (waiter's bow, sitting knee extension, quadruped rocking backward) and three extension-specific tests (posterior pelvic tilt, prone knee flexion, quadruped rocking forward)." [PMID:41927242]. The study reports: "The LM and TrA activation were measured using rehabilitative ultrasound imaging." [PMID:41927242]. The study reports: "TrA activation did not differ significantly between positive and negative groups (P > 0.05) across most tests, except prone knee flexion, which showed an unexpected increase in TrA activation in the positive group." [PMID:41927242]. The study reports: "However, TrA activation showed no consistent between-group differences." [PMID:41927242]. The retrieved evidence does not establish: treatment effects on 6MCTB performance or lumbar multifidus activation.

**Source-first decision**

The 6MCTB/LM association is retained with correct direction and source. However, the gap is recast as treatment effects on test performance or muscle activation; it does not acknowledge the frozen required gap about guided versus usual rehabilitation and pain, disability or long-term function. Strict failure for the wrong clinical-boundary scope, despite an appropriately partial label. Additional TrA and test-list quotations are supported but verbose.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Poorer individual, direction-specific, and summed 6MCTB performance was consistently associated with reduced lumbar-multifidus activation in patients with chronic low-back pain.

  Evidence `pubmed:41927242:0`:

  > Based on individual tests, direction-specific classification, and summation from the 6MCTB, poorer test performance was consistently associated with reduced LM activation in patients with CLBP.

Required evidence boundary: The study does not compare 6MCTB-guided rehabilitation with usual care or report effects on pain, disability, or long-term function.

## VMG-050

Do the supplied 6MCTB data show that assigning rehabilitation according to movement-control-test results improves pain or disability compared with usual rehabilitation?

**Saved Agent answer**

The retrieved evidence does not establish: improvement in pain or disability versus usual rehabilitation.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly withholds improvement in pain/disability versus usual rehabilitation from the supplied non-interventional 6MCTB data, without substituting muscle-activation association for treatment benefit.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: No intervention comparison assigns 6MCTB-guided versus usual rehabilitation or reports comparative pain and disability outcomes.
