In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, what cardiac MRI findings in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a cross-sectional pilot study of matched veterans, 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included to explore the relationship between systemic inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, and subclinical cardiac disease in HIV [PMID:41791688]. The study found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV [PMID:41791688]. These findings suggested the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in people living with HIV [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Both HIV and control groups are identified (21 versus 20); MRI findings and suggestive, noncausal wording are preserved.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Compared with controls, veterans with HIV had increased myocardial extracellular volume and lower right-heart function on MRI; the authors said these findings suggested increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

In the single-arm DYNAMITE study, what structural changes were measured at 9 months and what major adverse cardiac events were observed by 24 months after DynamX implantation?

**Saved Agent answer**

At 9-month follow-up in the DYNAMITE study, mean device area increased to 8.53 ± 1.71 mm2 (absolute difference: 0.37 ± 0.99 mm²; relative difference: 5.52 ± 14.8%, p = 0.010), and mean in-device lumen area decreased to 7.57 ± 1.86 mm2 (absolute difference: -0.70 ± 1.09 mm²; relative difference: -7.98 ± 14.9%, p <0.001) [PMID:41765253]. At 24-month follow-up, 4 patients (7.4%) experienced major adverse cardiac events, including one target vessel myocardial infarction and 4 target lesion revascularization events [PMID:41765253].

**Source-first decision**

Both 9-month structural changes, their P values, and the 24-month patient and event counts are preserved.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

We conducted a cross-sectional pilot study of matched veterans with and without HIV receiving care at the Providence VA Medical Center to explore the relationship between systemic inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, and subclinical cardiac disease in HIV [PMID:41791688]. We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population [PMID:41791688]. Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function [PMID:41791688]. The specific longitudinal question that remains unanswered is not explicitly stated in the provided text; the document only mentions the need for larger longitudinal studies to understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes.

**Source-first decision**

The matched HIV/control population, core MRI findings and missing longitudinal trajectory are stated, but the sample counts of 21 and 20 are omitted. The sentence denying an explicit longitudinal question is awkward; the same sentence nevertheless names the missing trajectory evidence.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

  > We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population.

Required evidence boundary: The cross-sectional pilot does not show the trajectory of cardiac changes or whether HIV causes them; larger longitudinal evidence is missing.

## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

SCAR-Net is a deep learning model specifically designed for ultrasound-based discrimination between postoperative scars and recurrent lesions in breast cancer [PMID:42023157]. The model was developed using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals [PMID:42023157]. SCAR-Net incorporates a scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules [PMID:42023157]. In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance by increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942 [PMID:42023157]. The model increased sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941 and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 [PMID:42023157]. All improvements in AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were statistically significant with p < 0.001 [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

Development size, both named modules, all radiologist metric ranges and significance are present with the correct single source.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) than in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL) [PMID:42000453]. Consistently, the tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 xenograft model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10) [PMID:42000453]. Saturation binding assays showed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited higher binding affinity for LGR5 (Kd = 74.11 ± 24.52 nM) than [68Ga]Ga-LTP-01 (Kd = 153.40 ± 17.14 nM) [PMID:42000453]. [68Ga]Ga-/[18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 demonstrated excellent stability, high target specificity, and partial hepatobiliary elimination, highlighting their potential as promising PET probes for imaging Nectin4-expressing tumors [PMID:41916034]. The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio increased progressively over time and reached its maximum at 120 min post-injection (p.i.) [PMID:41916034]. Notably, both tracers exhibited increased hepatic uptake accompanied by reduced renal accumulation, indicating a shift toward enhanced hepatobiliary clearance [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

The LGR5 positive/negative contrast and source-supported Nectin4 specificity are present. The Nectin4 positive-versus-negative model uptake contrast is omitted; clearance details do not replace that comparator. Additional binding and clearance claims were checked against both cited abstracts.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The first study reported that Ga-LTP-02 showed superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and localized LGR5-positive tumors effectively.

  > Among them, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors.

- **C2**: The second study found that the tracer accumulated specifically in Nectin4-expressing tumor models, with lower uptake in non-targeted tumors.

  Evidence `pubmed:41916034:0`:

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow, the AI system triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%; 95% CI: 173, 216) examinations with a sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and a specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9) [PMID:41960994]. In the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow, the AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001) [PMID:41960994]. In the multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001) [PMID:42023157]. Overall diagnostic accuracy increased with AI assistance to a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.88) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.82-0.91), respectively [PMC:doc260].

**Source-first decision**

Both target studies and their main numerical results are present, but the explicit radiologist sensitivity comparator (89.4%) is omitted, applying the same qualifier rule as the baseline. The trailing pooled sensitivity/specificity sentence comes from a third review and is presented as an overall AI-assistance result without identifying its separate population or study scope; it cannot serve as a pooled conclusion for these two requested studies.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: In simulated prostate-MRI triage, the AI pathway maintained sensitivity at 89.0% while increasing specificity by 11.5 percentage points to 69.2% versus the conventional pathway.

## VMG-013

What sensitivity-specificity tradeoff did simulated prostate-MRI AI triage show, and what real-world clinical effect remains untested?

**Saved Agent answer**

The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001) [PMID:41960994].

**Source-first decision**

The main simulated tradeoff and P values are present, but the radiologist sensitivity comparator (89.4%) and the missing prospective-deployment evidence boundary are omitted. Adjacent triaged-subgroup results do not answer the untested clinical-effect component.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The simulated AI pathway maintained sensitivity at 89.0% versus 89.4% for radiologists (P=0.36) and increased specificity by 11.5 percentage points to 69.2% (P<0.001).

  Evidence `pubmed:41960994:0`:

  > Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1).

## VMG-014

Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study is a simulation study and does not directly demonstrate a reduction in unnecessary biopsies or improvement in patient outcomes (e.g., cancer detection rate, missed cancers) versus a radiologist-only workflow in a clinical setting; it only simulates these outcomes based on diagnostic accuracy metrics.

**Source-first decision**

The answer correctly refuses a demonstrated biopsy or patient-outcome benefit and identifies simulation rather than clinical deployment. However, its trailing claim that the study simulates these outcomes from diagnostic metrics is unsupported: the frozen passage simulates diagnostic triage, not biopsy use or downstream patient outcomes. This extra assertion fails strict support despite correct abstention.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: The simulation reports sensitivity, specificity, and examinations triaged but no prospective comparison of biopsy use, treatment, morbidity, or patient outcomes.

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The fMRI acceleration method addressed the problem of time-consuming data acquisition by combining through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions [PMID:41951145]. The fMRI acceleration method used multiple image-shift strategies and a 2D Hadamard encoding scheme to increase encoding diversity and reduce slice leakage [PMID:41951145]. Validation of the fMRI acceleration method on simulated and experimental data showed a reduction in total scan time while achieving higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI) [PMID:41951145]. The fMRI acceleration method demonstrated potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions compared with conventional reconstruction strategies [PMID:41951145]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters addressed the problem of denoising images with high Rice's noise levels by proposing adapted filtering anisotropic diffusion PDE filter models using precise local parameters adjustment [PMID:41903663]. The MR anisotropic-diffusion filters incorporated a robust Rician noise estimator and unbiased variants of filters based on anisotropic diffusion with parameters calculated simultaneously and optimized adaptively through the PSO algorithm [PMID:41903663]. Validation of the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters on synthetic and real MR images provided excellent results compared to some other published methods, demonstrating high performance in noise reduction and preservation of important details [PMID:41903663].

**Source-first decision**

Both methods are linked to the correct papers: through-/in-plane acceleration, image shifts and Hadamard encoding with scan-time/SNR/CNR validation; Rician estimation and adaptive anisotropic filtering with denoising/detail-preservation validation. The additional activation-detection statement is explicitly qualified and supported by the fMRI source.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

For surveillance of local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence, what sensitivities were reported for nasopharyngeal-brush versus plasma EBV DNA testing?

**Saved Agent answer**

Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%) [PMID:41631491]. A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included in the study [PMID:41631491]. The value of nasopharyngeal brush versus plasma EBV DNA detection in diagnosing local recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [PMID:41631491].

**Source-first decision**

Both requested sensitivities are correct. The extra specificity and 187-patient details are source-supported. The trailing paper-title fragment is poor style but does not add an unsupported material claim; the Agent self-check failure is therefore a false negative under the frozen content rubric.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Nasopharyngeal-brush EBV DNA testing had 95.7% sensitivity versus 61.4% for plasma EBV DNA testing.

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

In this multicenter cross-sectional study, higher AV-access flow was significantly associated with increased left ventricular mass index (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; p = 0.27) [PMID:41644509]. The study enrolled a total of 241 hemodialysis patients who had undergone both transthoracic echocardiography and measurement of AV access flow between April 2014 and January 2024 [PMID:41644509]. The study cannot establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes because whether AV access blood flow and the duration of exposure to this flow have independent or interactive effects on cardiac outcomes remains unclear [PMID:41644509].

**Source-first decision**

The LV mass estimate, CI, P value and dialysis-vintage result are preserved. The answer identifies the cross-sectional design and explicitly says that an intervention benefit cannot be established. Its last causal explanation is indirect, but the bounded design and conclusion are present.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

A retrospective observational monocentric study was conducted on the cohort of women with singleton pregnancies who delivered vaginally in 2023 at the Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan [PMID:42036403]. A total of 3455 vaginal births were included: 3090 spontaneous vaginal births and 365 assisted vaginal births [PMID:42036403]. After adjusting for all factors considered, maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) were positively associated with assisted vaginal birth [PMID:42036403]. After adjusting for all factors considered, parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated with assisted vaginal birth [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic applications were associated with greater blood loss (p < 0.01) [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic applications were associated with a higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03) [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic applications were associated with increased ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01) [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All requested risk-factor directions and the three application-group differences are preserved, including both percentages and P values. The additional cohort details and odds-ratio confidence intervals match the cited abstract.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Older maternal age, mode of conception, epidural analgesia, later gestational age, and male newborn sex were positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, whereas parity was inversely associated.

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, what did online adaptation change in target coverage and organ-at-risk dose, and what treatment-time and toxicity results were reported?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, online adaptation significantly improved target coverage (median V100% change: +0.1%±2.5%) compared to predicted plans (-2.6%±7.3%, p < 0.001), without significant differences in OAR doses [PMID:42058324]. The median total treatment time was 28 min, with an average 5-minute ASRT workflow [PMID:42058324]. No grade ≥ 3 toxicities were reported; grade 2 events occurred in 10.3% of patients [PMID:42058324].

**Source-first decision**

The target-coverage comparison and P value, absence of a significant OAR-dose difference, both treatment-time measures, and both toxicity outcomes are all preserved with the correct source.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Online adaptation improved median V100% target coverage relative to predicted plans (+0.1%±2.5% vs -2.6%±7.3%; P<0.001) without a significant OAR-dose difference.

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study does not provide a direct comparison of local control or survival outcomes between the adaptive skin radiotherapy (ASRT) group and a nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy control group; it only reports outcomes for the ASRT cohort and compares dosimetry against predicted plans.

**Source-first decision**

Correctly states that the study lacks a nonadaptive comparison for local control or survival, and distinguishes single-cohort outcomes and dosimetric plan comparisons from the requested comparative clinical effect.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
