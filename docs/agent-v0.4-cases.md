# v0.4 development answers and evidence

These are real production-Agent outputs, not guided-demo fixtures. All 15 retained attempts
come from one development run at `a945a8f` using `qwen3.5:9b`.
The run was paused at the user's request after six completed answers and resumed on the same implementation. Those six answers were preserved unchanged; the interrupted seventh question had not produced an answer. Latency includes the retained completed attempts and an additional cold startup after resume.

The decisions below are Codex source-first adjudications, not independent clinician reviews.
Recalculation checks the saved mappings and arithmetic; it does not independently verify their semantics.

## VMG-001

In the cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, what cardiac MRI findings in people living with HIV suggested myocardial fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a cross-sectional pilot study of veterans, higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI were found among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688]. The study reports: "Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations. 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included." [PMID:41791688].

**Source-first decision**

Correct cross-sectional HIV/control MRI findings with suggestive, noncausal wording; the 21/20 populations and source-supported demographics are retained. Repeated population quotations are awkward but do not introduce a material factual error. The Agent checker incorrectly asks to remove the population details that the frozen rubric requires.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Compared with controls, veterans with HIV had increased myocardial extracellular volume and lower right-heart function on MRI; the authors said these findings suggested increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

## VMG-002

In the single-arm DYNAMITE study, what structural changes were measured at 9 months and what major adverse cardiac events were observed by 24 months after DynamX implantation?

**Saved Agent answer**

The primary co-endpoints were the difference in mean device area and mean in-device lumen area from postprocedure to 9 months as measured by optical coherence tomography [PMID:41765253]. At 9-month follow-up, mean device area increased to 8.53 ± 1.71 mm² (absolute difference: 0.37 ± 0.99 mm²; relative difference: 5.52 ± 14.8%, p = 0.010), and mean in-device lumen area decreased to 7.57 ± 1.86 mm² (absolute difference: -0.70 ± 1.09 mm²; relative difference: -7.98 ± 14.9%, p <0.001) [PMID:41765253]. The study reports: "A total of 55 patients (55 lesions) were enrolled. Mean age was 67 ± 10 years, 7% (n = 4) were female, and 29% (n = 16) were diabetic." [PMID:41765253]. At 24-month follow-up, 4 patients (7.4%) experienced major adverse cardiac events, including one target vessel myocardial infarction and 4 target lesion revascularization events [PMID:41765253].

**Source-first decision**

Correct 9-month device/lumen changes with absolute and relative estimates, uncertainty and P values, followed by 24-month MACE in 4 patients (7.4%) and the one MI/four revascularization events. The 55-patient cohort, demographics and OCT co-endpoint description match the abstract; no superiority to a stent comparator is claimed.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: From postprocedure to 9 months, mean device area increased by 0.37 mm² (P=0.010), while mean in-device lumen area decreased by 0.70 mm² (P<0.001).

## VMG-006

What evidence did the small HIV pilot provide for myocardial fibrosis and right-ventricular dysfunction, and what longitudinal question remains unanswered?

**Saved Agent answer**

The pilot study included 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) [PMID:41791688]. Multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations [PMID:41791688]. The study found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV [PMID:41791688]. These findings suggest the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population [PMID:41791688]. Limited data from this pilot study suggest that HIV may be associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased right ventricular function [PMID:41791688]. The study is cross-sectional and highlights the need for larger longitudinal studies to understand the trajectory of HIV-associated cardiac changes; it does not provide longitudinal data.

**Source-first decision**

Both groups (21 HIV veterans and 20 controls), GDF-15/ECV/right-heart findings and suggestive noncausal wording are present. Names the cross-sectional design and missing longitudinal trajectory. The additional multivariable-regression statement is supported by the same abstract.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The cross-sectional pilot found higher GDF-15, greater extracellular volume, and lower right-heart function in 21 veterans with HIV versus 20 controls, suggesting increased fibrosis and subclinical dysfunction.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > 21 veterans with HIV (mean age 54 years; 71% White, 29% Black) and 20 controls (mean age 56 years; 70% White, 30% Black) were included.

  Evidence `pubmed:41791688:0`:

  > We found higher growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blood levels, increased extracellular volume, and lower right heart function on MRI among patients with HIV, suggesting the presence of increased myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction in this population.

Required evidence boundary: The cross-sectional pilot does not show the trajectory of cardiac changes or whether HIV causes them; larger longitudinal evidence is missing.

## VMG-009

How was SCAR-Net built and validated for distinguishing postoperative breast scars from recurrent lesions, and how much did it change radiologist performance?

**Saved Agent answer**

SCAR-Net was developed using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals, incorporating scar-recurrence feature enhancer and boundary-sensitive attention network modules [PMID:42023157]. The model was validated using a multicenter validation study design involving 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients across four hospitals [PMID:42023157]. In multicenter validation, SCAR-Net significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic performance, increasing AUC from 0.810-0.824 to 0.939-0.942, sensitivity from 0.775-0.782 to 0.934-0.941, and specificity from 0.839-0.872 to 0.935-0.950 (all p < 0.001) [PMID:42023157].

**Source-first decision**

The development cohort, network modules and all diagnostic before/after ranges with P values are correct. The extra sentence stating that the model was validated in a design involving 34,376 images and 5,710 patients reuses development counts as validation counts. The source does not report that validation denominator, so this is one incorrectly scoped material addition despite complete core-claim coverage.

## VMG-010

What target-specific tumor-localization evidence was reported for the LGR5 tracer [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 and for the Nectin4 probes in their respective preclinical models?

**Saved Agent answer**

Saturation binding assays showed that [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited higher binding affinity for LGR5 (Kd = 74.11 ± 24.52 nM) than [68Ga]Ga-LTP-01 (Kd = 153.40 ± 17.14 nM) [PMID:42000453]. Dynamic PET imaging revealed considerably higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 in LGR5-positive A549 xenografts (4.74 ± 0.44 %ID/mL) than in LGR5-negative NCI-H1299 xenografts (0.98 ± 0.08 %ID/mL) [PMID:42000453]. Consistently, the tumor-to-muscle ratio was markedly higher in the A549 xenograft model (4.07 ± 0.07) than in the NCI-H1299 model (0.77 ± 0.10) [PMID:42000453]. Among them, [68Ga]Ga-LTP-02 exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGR5 expression and could effectively localize LGR5-positive tumors [PMID:42000453]. Cellular uptake assays demonstrated markedly higher accumulation of both tracers in MC38-Nectin4 cells (Nectin4+) compared with MC38 cells (Nectin4-negative, Nectin4-) [PMID:41916034]. In agreement with these results, biodistribution studies and PET imaging revealed pronounced and specific tracer accumulation in MC38-Nectin4 tumor models, whereas uptake in MC38 tumors remained substantially lower [PMID:41916034]. The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio increased progressively over time and reached its maximum at 120 min post-injection (p.i.) [PMID:41916034]. Moreover, tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-DN96 was consistently higher than that of [18F]AlF-NOTA-DN96 across all tumor models examined [PMID:41916034].

**Source-first decision**

Both studies' target-specific positive/negative model contrasts are explicit, including A549 versus NCI-H1299 uptake and MC38-Nectin4 versus MC38 uptake. Extra binding-affinity, tumor-to-muscle and 120-minute statements match their own abstracts. No patient diagnostic-accuracy or cross-study head-to-head claim; duplicate restoration is absent.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

## VMG-011

How did AI assistance change diagnostic performance in the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow and in multicenter breast-ultrasound scar-versus-recurrence assessment?

**Saved Agent answer**

In the simulated prostate-MRI triage workflow involving MRI examinations of 500 men with suspected csPCa from four European centers, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1) [PMID:41960994]. The AI-driven pathway maintained comparable sensitivity (89.0%; 95% CI: 85.0, 93.0; P = .36) but improved specificity by 11.5%, reaching 69.2% (95% CI: 64.4, 74.0; P < .001) [PMID:41960994]. The AI system triaged and diagnosed 195 of 400 (49%; 95% CI: 173, 216) examinations with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.5, 99.9) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5, 98.9) [PMID:41960994]. The study reports: "Results Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1)."

**Source-first decision**

Both requested comparisons, intervals and P values are retained, and the source quotation distinguishes 400 test patients from 500 total prostate participants. However, 'Using 34,376 ultrasound images from 5,710 patients ... improved radiologists performance' attaches SCAR-Net development-data counts directly to the validation-performance result without identifying the development role. The abstract reports those counts for development, not a validation denominator. Conservatively count one incorrectly scoped material addition, consistently with both focus runs.

What discrimination, sensitivity, and specificity did the catheter-related-thrombosis nomogram report in the oncology cohort?

**Saved Agent answer**

A nomogram integrating these variables demonstrated good discrimination (area under the curve = 0.866, 95% CI: 0.837-0.895), with a sensitivity of 70.33% and a specificity of 85.89% [PMID:42077124]. The study reports: "Clinical data from 600 consecutive patients who underwent port implantation at Zhongshan People's Hospital were analyzed. Patients were grouped according to final catheter tip position (SVC-RAJ versus non-SVC-RAJ), and CRT incidence was compared between groups." [PMID:42077124]. The study reports: "Background: In this single-center retrospective study, the authors evaluated whether real-time ultrasound-guided positioning of an implantable venous access port catheter tip at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction (SVC-RAJ) reduces the risk of catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in adult patients with cancer and developed a multivariable risk prediction model to support individualized prevention.Methods: Clinical data from 600 consecutive patients who underwent port implantation at Zhongshan People's Hospital were analyzed."

What sensitivity-specificity tradeoff did simulated prostate-MRI AI triage show, and what real-world clinical effect remains untested?

**Saved Agent answer**

Among the 400 patients (median age, 66 years; IQR, 60-69 years) included for testing, radiologists achieved a sensitivity of 89.4% (95% CI: 85.8, 93.1) and specificity of 57.7% (95% CI: 52.3, 63.1) [PMID:41960994].

## VMG-014

Does the supplied prostate-MRI study establish that deploying AI triage reduces unnecessary biopsies or improves patient outcomes versus a radiologist-only workflow?

**Saved Agent answer**

The study is a simulation without real biopsies; it measures sensitivity/specificity only and cannot establish reduction in unnecessary biopsies versus radiologist-only workflow. The study reports diagnostic accuracy only; it did not measure downstream patient outcomes such as mortality, metastasis, or quality of life.

**Source-first decision**

The answer correctly refuses to infer biopsy reduction or patient-outcome benefits from the simulation. However, 'a simulation without real biopsies' is an unsupported description of the underlying data: the abstract explicitly uses histopathology and/or at least three years of follow-up as reference standards. No prospective biopsy-use comparison is not the same as no real biopsy data. Count one unsupported material addition even though the comparative-benefit boundary is acknowledged; the broad 'only' wording also overlooks the reported examinations-triaged endpoint.

## VMG-018

How did the fMRI acceleration method and the MR anisotropic-diffusion filters address different image-reconstruction problems, and what validation result did each report?

**Saved Agent answer**

The fMRI acceleration method addresses image-reconstruction problems by proposing a novel image reconstruction method to enhance the efficiency of data acquisition while maintaining high accuracy in activation detection [PMID:41951145]. The fMRI acceleration method addresses image-reconstruction problems by combining through-plane and in-plane acceleration techniques to accelerate image acquisition along two dimensions [PMID:41951145]. The fMRI acceleration method reported that by applying the approach to both simulated and experimental fMRI data, it successfully reduced total scan time while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in regions of interest (ROI) [PMID:41951145]. The fMRI acceleration method reported that compared with conventional reconstruction strategies, the proposed method demonstrates potential improvements in activation detection under specific acceleration and encoding conditions [PMID:41951145]. The retrieved evidence does not contain information regarding 'MR anisotropic-diffusion filters' or how they address specific reconstruction problems. No validation results are reported for 'MR anisotropic-diffusion filters' in the retrieved evidence.

**Source-first decision**

The answer retains the fMRI through-plane/in-plane acceleration and simulated/experimental scan-time, SNR and CNR results, so its main C1 finding is mapped. It omits the required image-shift/2D-Hadamard method detail (one missing qualifier) and entirely lacks C2's anisotropic-diffusion/Rician-noise filtering method and validation. PMID:41903663 was not retained in retrieval. The explicit gap is truthful about the retrieved evidence, but cannot replace the missing answerable study; no cross-study ranking or unsupported outcome is added.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: The fMRI method combined through-plane and in-plane acceleration with image shifts and 2D Hadamard encoding; in simulated and experimental data it reduced scan time while increasing SNR and CNR in regions of interest.

For surveillance of local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence, what sensitivities were reported for nasopharyngeal-brush versus plasma EBV DNA testing?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a study of 187 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.7% for detecting local recurrence [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Patients without recurrence after more than 1 year of follow-up served as controls." [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%)." [PMID:41631491]. In the same study, plasma EBV DNA testing demonstrated a sensitivity of 61.4% for detecting local recurrence [PMID:41631491]. The study reports: "A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included." [PMID:41631491].

**Source-first decision**

Correct brush sensitivity 95.7% versus plasma 61.4%, with separately attributed comparisons. The 187-patient population, radiotherapy context, controls followed for more than one year and specificity 94.0% versus 96.6% are all supported. Repeated source quotations are a presentation defect, not an unsupported material assertion.

## VMG-032

What association did the hemodialysis study find between AV-access flow and LV mass, and why can it not establish that lowering access flow will improve cardiac outcomes?

**Saved Agent answer**

A total of 241 patients were included in the multicenter cross-sectional study [PMID:41644509]. Higher AV access flow volume (FV) was significantly associated with increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI) with a mean difference of 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; p = 0.046 [PMID:41644509]. The study design is cross-sectional, which precludes establishing causal relationships or predicting that lowering flow will improve outcomes.

**Source-first decision**

The main higher-flow/LVMI association, mean difference 22.83, 95% CI 0.37-45.29, P=0.046 and 241-patient cross-sectional population are correct. The causal/intervention boundary is correctly stated. However, C1 explicitly requires the contrast that dialysis vintage was not significantly associated; that contrast and its uncertainty are absent (one missing required qualifier). The core claims are mapped, but strict pass remains false.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

- **C1**: Higher AV-access flow was associated with a 22.83-unit higher LV mass index (95% CI 0.37-45.29; P=0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not significantly associated.

  Evidence `pubmed:41644509:0`:

  > Higher FV was significantly associated with increased LVMI (mean difference = 22.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 45.29; <i>p</i> = 0.046), whereas dialysis vintage was not (mean difference = 0.51; 95% CI: -0.41 to 1.45; <i>p</i> = 0.27).

- **C2**: Its cross-sectional design establishes neither temporal causality nor whether an intervention to reduce flow would lower LV mass or clinical cardiovascular events.

## VMG-034

In the retrospective vacuum-assisted-birth cohort, which factors were independently associated with assisted vaginal birth, and how did mid/low-pelvic applications differ from perineal applications?

**Saved Agent answer**

In a retrospective cohort of 3455 vaginal births (3090 spontaneous and 365 assisted), multivariable logistic regression identified maternal age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), mode of conception (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07-2.33), epidural analgesia (OR 6.25, 95% CI: 3.05-12.80), gestational age (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67), and newborn male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) as factors positively associated with assisted vaginal birth, whereas parity (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14-0.29) was inversely associated [PMID:42036403]. Compared to perineal applications, mid/low pelvic vacuum applications were associated with greater blood loss (p < 0.01), higher episiotomy rate (95.5% vs 88.2%, p = 0.03), and increased ultrasound use (62.4% vs 23.5%, p < 0.01) [PMID:42036403].

**Source-first decision**

All six independently associated factors are included with correct odds ratios and confidence intervals, including parity's inverse association. The 3455/3090/365 population counts, greater blood loss, episiotomy 95.5% versus 88.2% and ultrasound use 62.4% versus 23.5%, with their P values and application-site comparator, match the abstract. Association is not rewritten as causation.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

## VMG-039

In the prospective thoracic ASRT study, what did online adaptation change in target coverage and organ-at-risk dose, and what treatment-time and toxicity results were reported?

**Saved Agent answer**

Online adaptation significantly improved target coverage (median V100% change: +0.1%±2.5%) compared to predicted plans (-2.6%±7.3%, p < 0.001) [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "A total of 41 patients were enrolled, receiving 232 fractions, of which 178 (76.7%) were treated with ASRT." [PMID:42058324]. Online adaptation resulted in no significant differences in organ-at-risk (OAR) doses [PMID:42058324]. The study reports: "Online adaptation significantly improved target coverage (median V100% change: +0.1%±2.5%) compared to predicted plans (-2.6%±7.3%, p < 0.001), without significant differences in OAR doses." [PMID:42058324]. Median total treatment time was 28 min, with an average 5-minute ASRT workflow [PMID:42058324]. No grade ≥ 3 toxicities were reported; grade 2 events occurred in 10.3% of patients [PMID:42058324].

**Source-first decision**

Correct adapted-versus-predicted V100% change (+0.1%±2.5% versus -2.6%±7.3%, P<0.001), no significant OAR-dose difference, median total 28 minutes and mean ASRT 5 minutes. Both toxicity categories are present: no grade >=3 and grade 2 in 10.3%. The 41 patients/232 fractions/178 adapted fractions (76.7%) are source-supported. No survival superiority is asserted; one repeated quote is stylistic.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Does the supplied ASRT study show that adaptive skin radiotherapy improves local control or survival compared with nonadaptive thoracic radiotherapy?

**Saved Agent answer**

*No answer was returned; this is an execution failure, not a valid refusal.*


**Source-first decision**

Execution failed when evidence planning returned unusable structured output after the bounded retry; no answer was saved. An empty technical failure does not acknowledge the missing nonadaptive comparator and is not a valid abstention. Retain the failed attempt and its 226.98-second latency in the denominator. The failure row resets intermediate state; its empty retrieved-chunk list does not prove that retrieval was never attempted.

**Frozen claims and evidence**

Required evidence boundary: A comparative nonadaptive-radiotherapy group or randomized trial is absent, so the effect of ASRT on local control or survival cannot be estimated.
